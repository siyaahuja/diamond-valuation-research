Empirical Results
4.1 Data and Descriptive Statistics
The primary dataset comprises 13,876 retail diamond listings scraped directly from the James Allen product API in February 2026, spanning 6,676 natural and 7,200 laboratory-grown stones. All listings are round brilliant cut diamonds sold through the same retail channel, graded by either the Gemological Institute of America (GIA, n=8,207) or the International Gemological Institute (IGI, n=5,657), with prices ranging from $300 to $74,730 for natural stones and $300 to $4,030 for laboratory-grown stones. Carat weights range from 0.3 to 5.0 carats across both categories.
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics by origin. The raw price differential is striking: natural diamonds sell at a median price of $3,805 compared to $990 for laboratory-grown equivalents - a raw premium of 284% at the median before controlling for physical characteristics. However, raw price comparisons are confounded by differences in the distribution of physical characteristics across the two categories. The hedonic regression framework of Section 4.2 isolates the origin premium net of these confounds.
The distribution of physical characteristics is broadly similar across natural and laboratory-grown stones in this dataset. Mean carat weight is 1.63 for natural and 1.56 for laboratory-grown stones. The certification distribution differs substantially: 84% of natural diamonds in the sample carry GIA certification compared to 24% of laboratory-grown stones, reflecting the historical dominance of GIA in the natural diamond market and IGI's more recent expansion into laboratory-grown certification. This difference is controlled for in the regression.
A notable feature of the price distribution is multimodality at round carat thresholds - 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 carats - reflecting retailer pricing strategies that exploit consumer anchoring at psychologically salient weight points. This phenomenon, documented in the diamond pricing literature, is controlled for through indicator variables in the hedonic specification.
4.2 Hedonic Price Regression
We estimate a hedonic price regression of the form:
ln(price_i) = α + β₁ln(carat_i) + β₂cut_i + β₃colour_i + β₄clarity_i + β₅fluorescence_i + β₆cert_GIA_i + β₇origin_natural_i + β₈(origin_natural_i × ln(carat_i)) + β₉(origin_natural_i × clarity_i) + Σβ_k·bunch_k_i + ε_i
Where the dependent variable is the natural log of retail price in USD. Physical characteristic controls include log carat weight, cut grade encoded ordinally (Ideal/True Hearts=4, Excellent=3, Very Good=2, Good=1), colour grade (D=1 through K=8 on an ascending scale of decreasing quality), clarity grade (IF=2 through I1=9 on an ascending scale of decreasing quality), fluorescence intensity (None=0 through Strong=3), and a binary indicator for GIA certification. The origin dummy origin_natural takes a value of one for natural diamonds and zero for laboratory-grown stones. Interaction terms between origin and log carat weight and between origin and clarity capture heterogeneity in the premium across the size and quality distribution. Seven indicator variables control for carat bunching at psychologically salient thresholds (0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 carats). All standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust (HC3) following the detection of significant heteroskedasticity by the Breusch-Pagan test (LM=1,554, p<0.0001).
Table 2 presents results for four nested model specifications. Model 1 estimates the baseline hedonic specification on natural diamonds only, confirming that the standard Four Cs explain 97.4% of price variation within the natural diamond market. Log carat weight carries a coefficient of 2.12, implying that a 1% increase in carat weight is associated with a 2.12% increase in price - consistent with the superlinear carat-price relationship documented in prior literature and attributable to the increasing rarity of larger natural stones. GIA certification commands a 26.5% premium over non-GIA certified stones within the natural diamond segment, reflecting the market's stronger trust in GIA grading standards for natural stones.
Model 2 introduces the origin dummy into the pooled natural and laboratory-grown sample. The coefficient on origin_natural is 2.2265 (p<0.0001), implying that natural diamonds sell at an 827% premium over laboratory-grown equivalents after controlling for all physical characteristics. The model explains 93.2% of price variation across the pooled sample.
Model 4 - our preferred specification - adds interaction terms and carat bunching controls, raising explanatory power to 98.2%. The origin coefficient of 1.4258 (p<0.0001) represents the baseline origin premium at mean carat weight, evaluated at ln(carat)=0, i.e. at exactly 1.0 carats. The interaction term origin_natural × ln(carat) carries a coefficient of 0.8785 (p<0.0001), confirming that the premium scales superlinearly with carat weight. Evaluated at key carat thresholds, the estimated origin premium is 126% at 0.5 carats, 316% at 1.0 carats, 494% at 1.5 carats, 665% at 2.0 carats, and 992% at 3.0 carats.
4.3 Interpretation of the Origin Premium
The magnitude and structure of the estimated origin premium warrants careful interpretation. A 316% premium at 1.0 carats means that a consumer purchasing a 1.0 carat, D colour, VS1 clarity, Excellent cut, GIA-certified natural diamond pays approximately four times more than a consumer purchasing a stone with identical graded characteristics in laboratory-grown form. Since GIA and IGI both certify that the physical properties of the two stones are identical under laboratory conditions, the entire premium reflects non-physical attributes - origin, provenance, and the symbolic and positional utility that natural origin confers.
The superlinear scaling of the premium with carat weight is consistent with Proposition 2 of the theoretical framework: positional utility scales with the social visibility and legibility of the expenditure signal. A 3.0 carat natural diamond is not merely a larger stone - it is an unambiguous signal of significant discretionary expenditure that is legible to observers who know nothing about diamond grading. The 992% premium at 3.0 carats suggests that at the top of the market, consumers are paying almost entirely for symbolic value, with physical characteristics accounting for a small fraction of total price.
The GIA certification premium warrants separate comment. In Model 1 (natural diamonds only), GIA certification commands a 26.5% premium. In Model 4 (pooled with interaction terms), the GIA premium is 14.6%. The reduction reflects the compositional difference: GIA is predominantly associated with natural diamonds in this sample, and part of the certification premium in the pooled model is absorbed by the origin dummy. The residual 14.6% GIA premium represents the market's valuation of GIA's grading reputation independently of origin - consistent with the certification literature on third-party quality signalling.
4.4 Reddit Sentiment Analysis
The secondary dataset comprises 3,805 unique Reddit posts collected from r/Diamonds, r/EngagementRings, r/labdiamond, and r/jewelry between January 2015 and February 2026 using the Reddit JSON API. Posts were filtered to include only those containing explicit mentions of laboratory-grown or natural diamond terminology. VADER sentiment analysis was applied to the combined title and body text of each post, yielding a compound sentiment score ranging from -1 (maximally negative) to +1 (maximally positive).
Three findings emerge from the sentiment analysis. First, both natural and laboratory-grown diamond discourse is strongly positive throughout the sample period, with mean compound scores of 0.82 for laboratory-grown mentions and 0.79 for natural diamond mentions. This reflects the enthusiast character of the subreddits sampled - communities where members share purchases and celebrate choices - and constitutes a sampling caveat discussed in Section 5. Second, laboratory-grown sentiment was consistently higher than natural diamond sentiment from 2020 to late 2023, before the two series converge in 2024-2026. This trajectory is consistent with the period of rapid growth and consumer enthusiasm for laboratory-grown diamonds as a value proposition, followed by market maturation. Third, the convergence of sentiment scores from 2024 onwards coincides with the well-documented collapse in laboratory-grown diamond wholesale prices, which may have tempered consumer enthusiasm as resale value concerns became salient.
4.5 Topic Modelling
Latent Dirichlet Allocation with eight topics was applied to the full Reddit corpus. The dominant topic throughout the sample period is Price, Value & Origin, which accounts for a mean of approximately 40% of all discourse but declines from a peak of 60-70% in 2020-2021 to approximately 20-25% by 2025-2026. This trajectory is the most theoretically significant finding of the topic analysis: the declining dominance of origin as a deliberative topic in consumer discourse is direct evidence of the valuation lag described in Section 3.4. As the origin debate becomes settled among the leading-edge consumer segment captured by Reddit, discussion shifts toward topics that treat diamond selection as a conventional aesthetic and practical decision - cut styles, settings, metal choices - rather than a fundamental question of authenticity and value.
The rise of Technical Specs and Metal & Design topics from 2024 onwards is consistent with laboratory-grown diamonds achieving commodity status within this consumer segment: once the value question is resolved, the purchase decision is governed by the same considerations as any other jewellery purchase. This normalisation of laboratory-grown diamonds in consumer discourse, combined with the persistent price premium in retail data, constitutes the central empirical tension of the paper: origin has lost salience as a deliberative topic among informed consumers while simultaneously commanding its largest ever absolute price differential in the retail market.
4.6 Synthesising the Empirical Evidence
The three empirical components - hedonic regression, sentiment analysis, and topic modelling - together paint a coherent picture that maps directly onto the theoretical framework of Section 3. The persistent and superlinear origin premium in price data reflects the continued willingness of traditional and high-expenditure consumers to pay for symbolic value, consistent with the heterogeneous distribution of S_i in the model. The convergence of natural and laboratory-grown sentiment scores from 2024 suggests that the ethical and positional utility gap between the two categories is narrowing among the Reddit demographic. The declining dominance of origin discourse in the topic model reflects the erosion of tradition value T among informed consumers as the origin question becomes settled rather than contested.
Critically, both data sources operate within the mid-market segment and are therefore subject to a dual sampling constraint. The Reddit corpus underrepresents traditional luxury buyers who pay origin premiums without active deliberation - the consumer who chooses natural without considering laboratory-grown as an alternative is unlikely to appear in a subreddit structured around that very comparison. Simultaneously, James Allen as a mid-market online retailer underrepresents the ultra-high-net-worth buyer who purchases investment-grade stones through auction houses, private dealers, or bespoke jewellers, where origin premiums on exceptional natural stones routinely exceed those documented here. Our estimated premiums of 316% at 1.0 carats and 992% at 3.0 carats should therefore be understood as conservative estimates of the origin premium in the accessible retail market - a segment that is itself more price-sensitive and information-rich than the private client market where the symbolic value of natural origin is most deeply entrenched. The true premium at the top of the market, where a 10-carat D Flawless natural stone commands prices that laboratory-grown equivalents cannot approach regardless of grading, lies beyond the scope of the present study and represents a productive direction for future research using auction house data.

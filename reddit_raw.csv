http://www.ice.com/bracelets/gem-bracelets/14-1-4-ct-tgw-created-blue-white-sapphire-bracelet-silver-length-inches-7-25/

Couple of questions for y'all pros: are there any measures of sapphire quality without seeing the gem in person? My understanding is the deeper blue is considered higher quality and green/gray shades are undesirable but not sure how to otherwise evaluate the gem. 

Also, I definitely considered diamonds but everything I see in my price range is H-J and I1-I3 even with online dealers or synthetics. I would like to buy a nice piece that will last which is why I was looking at other gemstones. From my limited knowledge these aforementioned diamonds would be fairly dull and impure. 

I would definitely appreciate any general buying advice when it comes to diamond vs other gems as far what to expect for price, quality, etc. The only color she dislikes is purple, and preferred colors would be blue, white, red, and green. Should I try to find a private dealer in the area (San Antonio) since you are almost always overpaying at the large dealer?

tl;dr: How to pick quality sapphire/gemstone pieces and would low end diamonds still look good?

a mineral composed of pure carbon. It is the hardest naturally occurring substance known; it is also the most popular gemstone. Because of their extreme hardness, diamonds have a number of important industrial applications.

The hardness, brilliance, and sparkle of diamonds make them unsurpassed as gems. In the symbolism of gemstones, the diamond represents steadfast love and is the birthstone for April. Diamond stones are weighed in carats (1 carat = 200 milligrams) and in points (1 point = 0.01 carat). In addition to gem-quality stones, several varieties of industrial diamonds occur, and synthetic diamonds have been produced on a commercial scale since 1960.

1. I have 7 weeks to create the ring.
2. I am considering a three stone platinum setting, which I am currently planning to buy online.
3. The center stone I am considering ruby or sapphire, because we like colored stones, and those are nice and hard.  I'm thinking ~3 carats, because I'd like a large stone, but not comically large.  Thinking about round, cushion, or even oval cut.
4. The two side stones will be diamonds.  I'm not sure what size, maybe ~1 carat.  I like the idea of two pear cut, with the points oriented away from the center stone. I'm not focused on the quality of the diamonds.  As long as they look pretty nice, I'm happy
5. A complication: I'm going to be proposing overseas. I'd like not to bring the actual ring to the proposal site, so I'm hoping to also make an inexpensive copy (synthetic stones, non-precious metal) that looks similar, not necessarily identical, to the real custom ring.
6. Budget is $6,000-11,000 USD.


I have a few specific questions that perhaps some kind redditors might advise me on:

1. Where should I purchase the setting and stones? Specific websites are useful.
2. How do I ensure that the stones will fit into the setting?
3. What quality of stone should I aim for with the color stone?
4. What quality of diamond is necessary to look okay?
5. Any idea of a good way of going about getting a inexpensive copy made?

I don't take my jewelry off. Ever. Well, to clean it about once a month but that's about it. And that's become a problem.


Sadly, I lost the diamond stone out of my engagement ring after not knowing that the prongs had loosened. This happened about 6 months ago. My husband also gave me diamond earrings and one was lost somewhere along the way about a year ago. In addition, he also gave me a beautiful diamond pendant, fortunately that wasn't lost but the chain in a freak incident got caught in an electrical outlet while I was bending down over it and it zapped it in two - this happened over 2 years ago and I never replaced the chain.


I don't find it necessary at all to replace the engagement ring setting with a real diamond (sweet of my husband to insist, but no - when we were in pre-marital counseling before he officially proposed to me, I asked him to NOT get a real diamond, but he did). &lt;-- all of that to say I definitely don't want to get another real stone to replace what I at first never even cared about ever having. Nor do I care to have a ""real"" diamond earring to replace the lost one.


We have the money but it just seems to me a silly way to spend it.


I got Swarovski earrings, pendant necklace and a ring to wear as replacements but my husband thinks they look cheap, doesn't like them and lately keeps saying he wants to go out and get a new a stone put in the real engagement ring, another pair of diamond earrings and another chain for the diamond pendant, therefore, I need to get on this before he goes out without me to spend money unnecessarily.

55vclb,EngagementRings,synthetic diamond,1475609889.0,2016-10-04,2016,10,Afraid to buy online,"I've been looking at rings online for a while now, and I found a company that seems to have some amazing deals on synthetic diamonds.  They have an [online store on their website](https://segaljewellery.com/), and also have stores on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/SegalJewelry?ref=profile_shopicon) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;me=A193YTPS58UAPO&amp;merchant=A193YTPS58UAPO&amp;redirect=true).  


&amp;nbsp;


There are a couple of red flags I'm worried about.  

1.  All these stores seem to have opened up in the last couple months, and there are very few reviews to go on.  Their etsy store has one review, with the same picture and wording as one of the 3 or 4 reviews I found on their main site, and the amazon store has no reviews.  

2. All of the diamonds on offer seem to be exactly the same, differing only in carat: Color D, vvs1, excellent cut.  Most of the rings have exactly 1ct, 0.84ct, or thereabouts. I know they are Lab Grown diamonds, but one would expect some variation in color or clarity, right?  

3.  The prices for the lab created diamonds seem very low for the quality.  Prices on synthetic diamonds I've seen on a place like Brilliant Earth are significantly higher. I mean, this place offers a [ring with a 1ct., Color D, vvs1, excellent cut](https://segaljewellery.com/products/unique_engagement_ring_diamond_ring_14k_yellow_gold_antique_ring_white_diamond_-_reagan) for less than a grand.  And yes, I confirmed with the merchant that the prices include the stones and aren't for the settings only  


&amp;nbsp;

Am I right to be so skeptical? I for sure wouldn't buy from their main site, but should I be nervous buying from Etsy or Amazon?  I don't know about Etsy, but I feel like Amazon should be safe; if I get scammed and no ring arrives or the ring is not as described, I feel like amazon would be able to get my money back since it's through their site.

---

In my search for sourcing a moissanite center stone for an engagement ring, I was committed to paying less then the roughly $500 I was being quoted for a 6.5mm Charles &amp; Colvard DEF colorless Forever One moissanite.

After some digging, I ran across /u/autumngirlsoup's [post about Tianyu Gems](https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/6j0mfb/moissanite_from_tianyu_gems/?st=j5wzn8fy&amp;sh=435e31c3), a Chinese gemstone manufacturer with a direct buy storefront through Alibaba.

Alibaba works a bit differently from Ebay. It's designed so you, the buyer, can negotiate with a supplier for price per unit. Unfortunately there's not much to negotiate if you're only buying one or a handful of stones, so the price they give you is probably the price you're going to be paying.

This was my first time using Alibaba, so it was a bit of a learning experience. You start by finding the item you want and then starting an order for it. This creates a sort of chat box where you can talk to the supplier, and on the right is your contract that you'll be putting together for your order.

I spoke with a rep from Tianyu Gems, who quoted me **$92** for a [6.5mm 1ct DEF round colorless moissanite gem](https://tygems.en.alibaba.com/product/60420508599-804345749/Forever_one_DEF_color_VVS_round_belgium_cut_1ct_6_5mm_synthetic_clearly_moissanite_diamond_jewelry.html?spm=a2700.8304367.prewdfa4cf.101.2ce45eee2xDSn1). It was $30 for DHL Express shipping + $3.50 for customs tax, bringing the total to **$125.50 shipped**.

It took 3 days to process payment via credit card, and shipped out the next day. Shipping was incredibly fast. I received the stone two days after it was shipped. So, all in all, 6 days from ordering to receiving it.

It looks like gemstone to me, but I wanted to know if it was actually good at all, so I went to my jeweler to get the skinny. So here it is:

* It measures 6.5mm in diameter and the cut quality is good, but it's been cut a bit flatter. This makes it less brilliant, although it's probably imperceptible to an untrained eye, i.e. mine.

* It's DE colorless.

* It weighs 0.87ct instead of the advertised 1.00ct. This might be due to the flatter cut, but see below--moissanite weighs less than diamond, so it could be the lower density and/or cut.

* My jeweler was astounded at the price.

I've reached out to Tianyu Gems about the weight of the gem and will report back.

---

Overall, I'm very happy. It was well worth the risk, and it seemed to have paid off. I didn't expect it to be identical quality at 1/5th the price, but we can live with it being 9/10th the weight for 1/5th the price. I'll post some pics once it's polished and set in the ring, but for now, that's it.

I don't care much for mined diamonds, so the center stone would likely be replaced by a moissanite. I also don't mind the rubies to be treated as it would bring the price tag down, as long as they're the same sort of shade as the original piece.

For someone like myself who is a bit more rough wearing on everyday pieces, would 14k white gold be an appropriate choice? Would a rose cut center stone getting bumped around be too much of a problem (how much wear can a moissanite really take?)

Are things like the add-on warranties worth it? General ring buying advice is also greatly appreciated. 

The biggest thing for me is that my girlfriend wants a color gemstone. Her initial preference was Alexandrite, but it seems that natural ones are very expensive and there are many types of synthetics. After taking a look at a few other gemstones (Topaz, Tanzanite and Sapphire), we are leaning toward sapphire because it's the hardest and quite beautiful. Problem is that I got quoted $1500-$2000 for a 1/2 carat sapphire. From my basic research, that seems to be quite a bit on he high end of the price spectrum. Seems about the same as the price of diamond! Does anyone have helpful tips on how to shop sapphires so I don't get taken to the cleaners? What questions do I need to ask to see if it's worth that much?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Though this pdf is slightly outdated, it'll give you a much better perspective of just how badly you're being ripped off by your diamond dealer or jeweler. This pdf explains that as of 2015, synthetic diamond is 30% cheaper to produce than natural diamond in Surat, India. That percentage has since increased as synthetic diamond continues to take over the diamond trade making naturally mined diamonds obsolete.

There are a wide range of predictions on the net as to when the global diamond trade will collapse altogether. Some predict we'll begin to see the early-stages of collapse by 2020, while others have a more optimistic view and are predicting in the next decade.

This thread is being posted as a real-world gauge so that anyone can can avoid being ripped off by unscrupulous diamond dealers. And I'm going to refer to a recent post that shows just how quickly we're going to see synthetics take control of the diamond trade and watch the value of natural diamonds plummet in a free-fall collapse!

[$15,000 natural or $3,000 synthetic diamond](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamonds/comments/8ac6xl/being_offered_to_me_for_3300_what_do_you_think/)

The cheapest stone I could find on [James Allen](https://www.jamesallen.com/loose-diamonds/round-cut/1.84-carat-g-color-si1-clarity-excellent-cut-sku-3687312) that's closest to the above example is being sold for $15,000. But I've seen others as high as $21,000.

If synthetics are 30% cheaper to produce and this stone above is used as a pricing gauge, then a natural diamond that's identical to this one above should only cost 30% more or $4300. But that's clearly not the case....is it?

The evidence shows that the price of synthetic diamonds is plummeting and the global collapse of the diamond trade is on the very near-horizon!

So before buying any diamond whether it be a natural stone or a synthetic, ask your jeweler or diamond concierge for identical examples of both natural and synthetic based on current market values and equal profit margins. And if your dealer refuses to sell you a synthetic, then you'll absolutely know that you should walk away from anything they offer. Cuz that seller is trying to dump their natural diamond inventory before the collapse hits and is not serving your best interests. That dealer is looking to rip you off just before they file for bankruptcy!

My fiancee and I would like to make a custom aquamarine wedding ring to go with my engagement ring that was his grandmothers. We wanted a specific cut and we also wanted the aquamarine stone to be from the Antero mine in colorado (near our home). Because we are being so specific it has been hard to find a jeweler who can accommodate this. Luckily I found a stone cutter who has a source from that mine and works with an amazing jeweler! Today they asked what our maximum budget is. We have no idea even a ballpark of what a custom ring like this should cost. When working with other jewelers we first had a quote of $4,000 and went to another jeweler and was quoted $600 so it left us feeling totally lost. The link below is similar to what I want. I would want a half moon shaped aquamarine with small diamonds on the round upper portion. It would lay flush with my engagement ring which is just a gold band with 7 small diamonds across the front.

I know what I want, I'm just unsure which site/brand to go with. I pretty much want a single diamond type necklace.

Right now i'm looking at 2 choices but am open to others:

https://vraiandoro.com/products/solitaire-diamond-necklace?variant=12458878107714

https://ferkosfinejewelry.com/collections/diamond-necklaces/products/14k-diamond-solitaire-necklace-on-a-bail?variant=5809226252326

I initially was set on the vrai and oro, until I realized shipping itself was going to cost $34-35. I then began trying to look at other possible options. I came across a very similar looking necklace on Etsy from Ferkos Fine Jewelry and found the necklace on their official website.

I can basically get the same necklace from Ferkos, and it'll be slightly bigger carat wise (0.12 vs 0.1) for a much lower price (considering currency conversion).

My concern is, why is there such a price difference? $335 vs. $275 and the 275 has a bigger carat. What other factors are involved? With the V&amp;O, am I paying for a brand name or am I paying for better quality and better cut? Or will the quality be the same? Is there any difference in the chain?

I just want to know if there is any difference in quality/presentation of the necklace. If the V&amp;O one is legitimately better then I won't hesitate to pay the extra $, but if it's not or if the quality is very close then I would just go with the Ferkos.

For V&amp;O, it says: Sustainably grown through technology in Silicon Valley, Diamond Foundry is supplying a closed door industry with a traceable, sustainable, real alternative to mined diamonds. All diamonds are G-I color and SI+ quality. Learn more about our diamonds at www.diamondfoundry.com.

So V&amp;O seems to be G-I color and SI+ quality and the Ferkos one is G Color VS-SI Clarity. Is that the same...?

Finally has anyone had any experience with Ferkos jewelry? Why is the Ferkos one cheaper than the V&amp;O?

I am also open to other suggestions other than the 2 I listed.

Will synthetic diamonds continue to drop in price? When do you think will be the sweet spot to buy? I don't want to pay 12K for a diamond and then have it be worth 5K 3 months from now.

Now, I'm a pretty skeptical buyer in general, so I've held off on making any purchases on something I know less than little about, but I wanted to know if anyone had any experiences dealing with fake gems before.

For instance, one of the owners was offering a 7.6 carat sapphire for around $350, which to me, seems both excessive and oddly inexpensive at the same time.  He used one of those presedium testers on it, and the needle very easily read as a corundum (that's sapphires, rubies, and emeralds, correct?), and for good measure showed me his fake sapphires he keeps as well, which just read as glass on the device.  However, I have read that devices such as it can't tell the difference between natural and synthetic stones.  

So, it could just be a really elaborate setup to get me to go in on some a synthetic sapphire, but I've heard plenty from other deployed soldiers that they bought real gems and ended up turning a profit on them back home.

Ultimately, my gut says, ""if it's too good to be true, it probably isn't"" and I'm not looking to hustle some precious stones back home.  What I would like to get though is a stone for the mrs and in that regard, synthetic vs natural isn't as big a deal to me, though I'll admit I'm curious if it is possible to make a profit otherwise.

bwfy7j,jewelry,mined diamond,1559595595.0,2019-06-03,2019,6,Help with getting our engagement ring repaired properly,"An unfortunate accident with ceramic toilet lid left my wife's ring damaged beyond repair. After some back and forth with our insurance (Jeweler's Mutual) they agreed to our jeweler ordering new ring directly from the manufacturer. The ring is a Zeghani zr917 but they had to order it with an 8mm head. Our stone is a 1.96 carat old mine cut diamond. 

The accident happened back in February so when they called us last month with it ready we were pretty anxious to get the ring back. They asked us to fill out the paperwork for Jeweler's Mutual and sent our old ring to them so they would get the check from insurance and would be able to give us the ring when we came to pick it up.

When we went to pick up the ring the first time we both immediately pointed out it did not look like our ring at all. The diamond was set much lower and the filgaree was much wider and higher than it was in our original ring. The jeweler notified after looking at the pictures and said they would order it again to get the right mounting. Fast forward to this weekend and we rush out there after work Saturday and make it there right before closing. They give us the ring and have us pay taxes because apparently insurance doesn't cover that but before we leave we notice again it is not right. The diamond is set higher in this head but the head is in the shape of a box instead of rounded. My wife went back to tell the jeweler and they initially got a bit defensive and said it was a minor detail but to us it is like a different ring. She then told us the ring is made stock with a 6mm so perhaps 4 years ago when I had it made they just bent out the prongs on a 6mm to fit our stone. She told us just take the ring home and come back with pictures of what we want done.

I wish we had better picture of the ring before all this happened but here is what we could find.

This was the first repair

And this is what we have now.
http://imgur.com/gallery/9Rhy7wr

There is a massive amount of space between the diamond and the mounting and as we were trying to get these pictures of it today we noticed the diamond is loose. We can move it back and forth and you can freely turn the stone in the mounting.

How do we describe what we want to the jeweler? The original rings mounting was like a tulip. It had a rounded shape and was widest at the top of the diamond. The repair attempts have a much wider ring coming up to the head where it is basically a straight line down from the edge of the diamond to the ring. There is no tapering or narrowing and I believe that is the difference we are seeing.

Tldr: we are on the 3rd repair attempt and just need help on how to communicate to the jeweler what we want. 1st set of pictures is the original and 3rd is what we have now.",2,1,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/bwfy7j/help_with_getting_our_engagement_ring_repaired/

I have been doing my internet research on sapphires, specifically natural, unheated blue sapphires. I would love to have one. I'm open to just buying the gem outright and then having a local jeweler set the gem in a ring. I wonder if this is the best route to go especially if purchasing online.

Also, where do I even start online? I'm so suspicious of companies claiming this or that for ethically sourced, high quality sapphires. I basically don't want to shell out some money and end up being duped when I have a jeweler appraise the item later.

Although I've thought about lab created sapphires, I want natural because this is the only item of  real, high-end jewelry I plan on owning and I want it to be special and valuable in a quality, timeless sense.

cc6d1w,jewelry,mined diamond,1562907196.0,2019-07-12,2019,7,What's the deal with jade?,"My fascination with mesoamerican jade artifacts has led me to look for a piece for myself (a ring, ideally) with similar marbling patterns as some pieces I’ve seen in museums. By this I only mean the apple green and white that appears on some pieces such as [this](https://www.bidsquare.com/online-auctions/artemis-gallery/maya-jade-earspool---apple-green-hues-1347893) mesoamerican piece or on [this](https://www.gia.edu/jade) Chinese carving on the GIA website. The pieces I’ve seen in real life have translucent parts to them and are very attractive pieces despite not having a uniform color. The contrast with the green and white seems to make the green stand out more.

In an attempt to look for a central American source in the maya region, the original source of the aforementioned jade, all that really comes up are the suppliers “Jade Maya” (which according to them “remains the largest jade operation in Central and South America”) and “La Casa del Jade”. I didn’t see anything about how the former tests their Jade, but the latter says they use the GIA and/or Guatemala’s counterpart. They all offer several colors of jade in their products, but nothing apple green and white and certainly nothing that translucent. Maybe they sell pieces of uniform color on their site since you can pretty much know what you’re getting, but they have more uniquely patterned pieces in their showroom? Who knows. Either way, I was unable to find any of this white and green jade sourced from the Maya region itself.

Looking at other North American sources, “The Jade Mine” in British Columbia sells only nephrite, they have some nice pieces but they’re all green and more opaque than not save for their “polar jade” that seem to be mostly uniform and translucent (which explains why they export so much to China). Some Wyoming Jade can be had from a variety of sources (reputable looking or not) but it’s also very uniform. The only reputable seller I found that offers pieces in the previously described type of stone is Mason Kay based in Colorado, who appears to not only supply their own pieces but also resells estate pieces.

Logically the next place to look is where Jade is exceptionally important, China. In my research it is without a doubt that translucent emerald green “imperial” jade was the most valuable, and often beat diamond prices. However, for pendants and carvings all white jade is also very valuable, as is white mixed with green like the sort of interest in this post. I found that mainland Chinese people will sometimes go to Hong Kong to buy pieces since so much of the world’s jade passes through there, so I searched more about jade in Hong Kong. In summary, there are a [few very well known and reputable jewelers](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/hong-kong/articles/where-to-buy-jade-in-hong-kong/) who offer top quality pieces with documentation of authenticity, and then there’s the Jade market with hundreds of stalls where you’re really rolling the dice and you ought not pay too much for anything that doesn’t have paperwork. For the authentic places, not one of the ones I found actually sell pieces online, so you have to go to Hong Kong if you want to buy anything. The general sentiment online seems to be that unless you have paperwork for a jade piece from a reputable lab (such as the GIA or one of the services in Hong Kong) it’s very likely it has been color treated with some sort of acid or filled with resin and isn’t worth very much as a now damaged stone.

In my research about Chinese jade I found out about the well documented human rights abuses in Burmese Jade mines, (maybe Northern China is better?) so I don’t really feel inclined to buy a piece any more, but then again that disqualified things like Nestle chocolate and cell phones with coltan, so maybe that makes me a hypocrite. Either way, I wouldn’t want to omit it from this post.

So maybe secondhand pieces are slightly more ethical? After finding absolutely no Chinese dealers online for jade jewelry that offered certification, I looked again for western sources. “Orientaljadejewelry” has excellent prices but doesn’t appear to offer certification, ditto for most other resellers.

Am I right in assuming that Chinese demand for jade is so great and that jade treatment is so prevalent that there's close to no sources of quality jade outside of China and Hong Kong? Maybe I haven't done enough research, I'm likely oversimplifying a complex market.

Does this pricing seem correct?,"I am shopping for an engagement ring and am looking for two diamond trillions to place next to a diamond I already own. I visited a local jeweler and found a trillion that is between 0.15-0.2 carats that looks really nice next to the diamond. I was later quoted $1050 for 2 of these trillions totaling \~1/3 carat. They told me I would be getting the first trillion for $450 as they'd had it in store a while, and they would order the second and it would cost $600. I didn't confirm buying anything at that time.

Now, my girlfriend and I both like the idea of lab grown diamonds for ethical reasons (not judging, not here to discuss that). I have also done some reading about lab grown diamonds, and the general consensus is that they are a somewhat less expensive (I've read anywhere from 10-25%) than mined diamonds. I emailed the jeweler to ask about lab grown diamonds, and he told me lab grown diamonds would cost me $1450 - $725 a piece. So this is about 20% more than the mined trillion they would order in.

Basically, does this pricing seem correct? I don't know much about diamond prices besides what I've read saying lab grown is cheaper. I'm not saying I'm being ripped off, as my mom has had good experiences with this jeweler in the past. It could very well just be a great price for the mined trillions. I could probably still swing the more expensive lab grown price, I just want to make sure I'm not overpaying you know? Especially since the quote goes against what I've read.

Sorry for the long post. Let me know if any more info is needed.

Thanks for your help!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit for info: The trillion was colorless or very near it. The jeweler did not say what grade the clarity was, but it looked very clear to me. And the prices I mentioned do not include any of the gold work, only the diamonds.

Not sure how true that is for all jewelry, but I guess her advice has started to sink in: I’ve been wanting to mitigate some of the guilt I feel about spending on something as non-essential as jewelry by investing into quality pieces that will hold onto their value. I'm just not sure where to start.

Since I want something that could stand up to regular wear, my focus has been on solid gold. I read somewhere that, although 24k gold is 100% pure gold content, 14k and 18k gold alloys are more ideal for jewelry given better resilience. Is that true, and if so, what incentive is there to pay for 18k over 14k?

As for gemstones: I love the look of pearls but don't know much about which types are a better buy (just that saltwater is generally considered more valuable than freshwater). What should I be on the lookout for regarding pearls? Also, diamonds are so pretty but more of a stretch financially…are white sapphire and other less-hyped, mineral gemstones still a worthwhile investment? And for when they are a financial possibility: are lab grown diamonds gimmicky/bad investments over natural ones? 

Regarding retailers: I’ve poked around on this sub for a bit and get the general consensus is that buying from locally-owned jewelers is best to avoid over-inflated markups. I have two concerns about this though: how do I know which local jewelers are reputable? I am also afraid I don't know enough about jewelry to be a discerning shopper and could risk being led into an irresponsible purchase. Ditto for if I were to opt to shop online, how do I vet a fine jeweler on Etsy or eBay?

gni2m0,jewelry,mined diamond,1590002962.0,2020-05-20,2020,5,Your pro opinion about this ring repair,"Greetings! Boy, do I have a doozie.

My engagement ring is 14k gold with a large aquamarine stone. Yes, I know, it's a beryl. It isn't strong. But I literally only wear my ring outside the house, never to bed, never to bathe, never to do housework in. (I posted about this ring on here previously with regard to prong issues, so if you're having deja vu, welcome back.)

I had a number of issues with the stone coming loose within the prongs. After having the prongs adjusted and redone by the original jewelry store and them leaving mangled messes behind, I switched to a better jeweler who makes her own pieces by hand in her shop.

She did one great prong repair on one, but a few months later, another prong started to go. I took it back for her to fix. She fixed the prong, but it was unable to line up with the others because she realized the head of the setting was really the issue, and without repairing the head, I'd have these prong issues for life.

So, she sent the head out to be redone (wider?). In this process, the metal was damaged by tools (you can see tool prints in the 14k gold). Somewhere in this process, the stone ended up cracking in half.

So, to make it right, she really tried her absolute hardest. She tried to match the aquamarine color and shape (a vintage cut, and super pale) and molded and sent the ring out to be completely recast in new 14k gold. I trusted her to do this because she truly is one of the best jewelers in the area!

What we got back was very different. Her team member insisted it was 100% identical and sort-of accused me of making stuff up, but I had side-by-side photos to compare! It wasn't until I spoke with the actual store owner/professional jeweler did she explain that:

1. This stone they selected was the highest quality around. They went through three gem companies to find it. It has the same color and size of my previous stone and was custom cut. No two stones are alike (obviously) because they come from the earth, and this was the closest match to be found. There wasn't available the same/similar size/color/shape as the original.
2. In recasting the ring for this new gem, the jeweler had to make adjustments to the head of the ring again. This was her explanation about why the leaf pattern no longer lines up under the stone, and corner to corner, and is more of a flat, misshapen tear drop shape. Basically, they didn't make adjustments to the architecture of the ring to maintain the original design -- is how I'm interpreting it.

My expectations were that this would be identical to the ring I originally sent for repairs. I was not made aware that there would be differences due to accommodating stone sizes and that they wouldn't make adjustments to keep the same design to accommodate it -- or that they could not source a square-shaped stone with facets and pale color similar to mine.

All of this at this point was done at no-charge, which I greatly appreciate! I was willing to pay for parts of the repair, since I was obviously going to pay her for the original work before this entire thing crumbled before our very eyes.

You can see the photos here for comparison:

2. What is the estimated value on this ring (if you're allowed to make such suggestions)? I know what I paid for it (\~$300 with a 50% discount from a family jeweler). I'm just entirely frustrated that this is what my ring is now, and I'm considering using the metal toward a different ring altogether, purchased from a different jeweler.I can't really afford a diamond (and didn't want one in the first place), but this jeweler who did the repairs insinuated I was lucky they were so kind to have replaced the stone because it's a beryl-family gem and they don't normally replace it when they break in their care. I feel like I'm being guilted into getting a diamond! If I were to get a new ring, this one would need to go toward the purchase price.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance, Reddit!

TLDR; After basically being completely rebuilt from the ground up, the ring I received is not the same as the ring I originally sent for repairs, and I want to know if this is a typical result.",3,7,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/gni2m0/your_pro_opinion_about_this_ring_repair/

If I were to get a real diamond, I'd like to get a synthetic one.  Most sites selling lab diamonds don't have a very good variety of ring styles, and nothing so far that's matched what she's shown an interest in. 

What's the process if I wanted to order a lab diamond online and try to put it in a ring either from another site or some a store somewhere? Do I need to take the stone size into consideration when ordering the ring, or can they all be adjusted to hold pretty much anything?  And then any old jeweler can set it for me? Is that cost significant enough that I need to take it into consideration? 

What's the current take on ""fakes""? Moisonite, CC Moisonite, the apparently numerous types of CZ, etc? Honestly, if it looks the part and I can afford something a little bigger, she probably wouldn't care *that* much that it's not as genuine as can be.

(Olivia) Moissanite Engagement and Wedding Band","I accidentally lost my wife's wedding and engagement bands (soldered together) and we gave up on trying to find them around the house after about a month. I did some searches online and saw some great reviews about [Wuzhou Provence Jewelry Co., Ltd.](https://wzprovence.en.alibaba.com/) and [Wuzhou Tianyu Gems Co., Ltd.](https://tygems.en.alibaba.com/?spm=a2700.icbuShop.88.28.70aa5c52LcexDa) I reached out to both companies.

We were trying to reproduce what was lost, a [1 ct. Moissanite engagement ring and a wedding band](https://imgur.com/llaONZK) (with diamonds, but decided moissanite is identical and much less expensive). 

[Wuzhou Tianyu Gems Co., Ltd.](https://tygems.en.alibaba.com/?spm=a2700.icbuShop.88.28.70aa5c52LcexDa) gave us an estimate of [$750](https://imgur.com/zLPXthH) and [Wuzhou Provence Jewelry Co., Ltd.](https://wzprovence.en.alibaba.com/) gave us an estimate of [$516](https://imgur.com/tLsTmQN). We went with Olivia and Wuzhou. The order process was pretty simple. I'm in the United States so the time difference kinda sucks, but ordering from an american company would've close to tripped the cost so a very small price to pay. Here's the final [CAD drawing](https://imgur.com/ZTsRNTK) we agreed to.

So now for what you really want to see, the [pictures and videos](https://imgur.com/a/lFem5zq). My iPhone 7 does not do the rings justice! My wife hates taking the rings off (she can't wear them to work as she's a front line worker with COVID-19 and has to put gloves on at work). When my wife put it on and stepped outside and into natural light we could not look at it without getting blinded, this thing POPS!

My wife was sceptical about ordering from a company in China as the original rings came from companies in the USA, but the other reviews on reddit were too good to not look into this route. 

I'd use Olivia again. I am not getting any kick backs, discounts, or coupons for posting this review, just wanted to give my mine and my wife's honest opinions about the experience.

hztcr0,jewelry,natural vs lab,1595993553.0,2020-07-29,2020,7,ELI5: Why is Platinum Jewelry More Expensive than Gold?,"I'm in the process of looking into engagement rings and I'm confused as to why platinum jewelry is so much more expensive than gold jewelry, even though it's much cheaper by weight in terms of pure metals.

- I know that gold is mined more plentifully than platinum. In fact, it's mined almost 10x as much. But if platinum is rarer/more scarce than gold, why is it a cheaper price for pure platinum than 24k gold?

- I know that platinum is more dense than gold, as well as the fact that gold is mixed with other metals (silver, nickel, etc.) to use as an alloy in jewelry to help offset the cost and softness of gold. Even if a ring made of 95% platinum is 50% heavier by weight, how does using, say, 6g of $31/g metal cost more than using 4g of $63/g metal? Looking volumetrically, the metal to wax ratio for casting 14k gold is 14:1 and platinum is 22:1. So, for the same exact ring, it'd be like 50% more material, but a cheaper material.

On the other hand, I have two ideas on why platinum *could* cost more:

- Platinum has a melting temperature of over 3000 degrees, while gold's is around 1900. This means more specialized equipment for casting. Counter point: if I was ordering a ring shank from an established foundry, and they provide a service for platinum, doesn't that mean they already have the equipment to do the casting? This could be entirely more labor intensive, even if it's a similar process, or components like the mold material could cost more.

- Platinum also has more tensile resistance to it, meaning that bending a prong for a setting requires some more strength behind it vs. gold, but it's still just the same act of bending a prong. Counterpoint: it's not really that big a difference in work, is it?

I'm assuming that perhaps a large part of the cost being driven up is due to the processing side, but... everything points to that platinum should be cheaper than gold. At least, by my logic.

Naturally, I understand this doesn't include anything like casting and cleaning, setting costs, stones, or shipping, but I'd assume if you were comparing the same design and stone between two different ring materials, those costs would be the same.",4,2,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/hztcr0/eli5_why_is_platinum_jewelry_more_expensive_than/

I'm pretty determined that she not see it until I propose, but I solicited advice from both her sister and her best friend. They told me contradictory things, so I did go to her and she basically served as a tie-breaker between them, and assessed some rings I'd nixed to tell me what she WOULD HAVE thought of them (I want to he clear that all the advice I've gotten has been fully solicited, she isn't being a prima dona or anything). After all that, here's where I stand:

-Don't break the bank, 10K gold or even sterling silver is fine, and neither of us wants a diamond.

-Not too flashy, the primary stone should be no bigger than 4 MM x 4 MM.

-No yellow gold, if its gold go white.

-She likes fall colors.

-Synthetic stones are fine.

-No sapphires of any color (long story).

Budget is about $1500, but I would ideally prefer to spend under $1000 if I can. Under $500 would be fantastic. Jewelry isn't the MOST important thing to me, and I would rather save cash for more practical things. I keep flipping back and forth on whether to buy on etsy vs from a jeweler. I initially started looking at [Newado Jewel](https://www.etsy.com/listing/726144279/6-prongs-set-wedding-ring-round-cut-8mm?pro=1&amp;frs=1) on etsy; her rings are beautiful and just what I like, plus she has great reviews.

I next looked at Oore which I also like, but it's a lot more for another etsy ring, none of which I would get to try on before purchasing. I live in NYC and have been considering Catbird and The Natural Sapphire Company, as I would get to see those in person. With Catbird, I'm concerned about the super thin bands, and don't want them to wear out with time. I don't see the point of going with Catbird if the band will wear out when I like rings on etsy better for cheaper. As for NSC, I was happy with that, but people on this subreddit seem to not like them. I'm also looking at Earth's Treasury, but for both this and Oore I wouldn't be able to order and return for certain reasons on my end, so I would have to keep what I have. And on the last note, even the jewelers I'm looking at don't have warranty for normal wear and tear, so I'm wondering if that warranty really IS any better than what is on etsy (assuming it's a good jeweler). Basically, is there anywhere I can get a reliable blue-green gem that will last and isn't overpriced? Bonus points if it's under $1000? Synthetic is fine. I don't know if what im asking is unreasonable or if I'm just looking in the wrong places. And side question, I read here that tiny moissanite gems on the side can look cheap, is this true?

Diamonds - I know, the CLASSIC - beautiful, hardest stone you can get... hardest on the wallet as well, even lab grown is expensive. I also really am turned off by the diamond marketing schemes, so I’ve looked into alternatives. 

Moissanite - Also super hard! Super pretty and sparkly! I’ve heard some people complain about the “disco ball” effect, or that it can be off colored and look yellow or green? I’ve never seen one in person, but they do appeal to me, having several of the good traits of diamonds, and being easier on the wallet as well. Has anyone ordered one and it came out hideous?

Cubic Zirconia - I’m really torn. I know it’s meant to be a synthetic lookalike for diamond - I just get the impression that it’s super cheap or tacky looking. When I hear CZ, I think of the cheap little plastic gemstones you see in kids costume jewelry. Does anyone have rings with a CZ stone? Do you love it? Regret it?

We started dating about 3 months ago. My girlfriends birthday is coming up next month and I am hunting for a gift. We are not at super big gift status yet (we are also young professionals so) and I am trying to find a good gift. 

I was thinking a basic chain or bracelet with a significant charm on it. Then I can have a fall back to get her charms at other significant events in our lives (she graduates in 3 months, first anniversary, big trips, moving in together, etc) and it can grow with us. It will also be fairly cheaper than most jewelry. 

I just don’t know what companies to go with who would also be dependable to be around for years to come.

Another question is her jewelry type is fairly understated. She loves yellow gold over anything else but most of her jewelry is fairly basic. She is a smaller woman (5 feet 100 lbs) so even medium sized jewelry looks big on her. I am worried that this could snowball out of control or be too gaudy for her tastes.

Can you please critique my present idea and, if you approve, suggest jewelry companies to look that are known for the charm based jewelry?

I know Etsy has a lot of great small businesses, but I'm afraid that I will not get what I actually ordered -i.e. I'll get silver with gold plating, and not 14K gold, lab-created stone instead of natural etc. This actually happened when I tried to order for the first time, so I'm little hesitant to try Etsy again, but I would give it a go again if someone has a trusted seller from EU.",3,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/ms1qdw/eubased_fine_jewlery_shops/

mu58zz,jewelry,mined diamond,1618851971.0,2021-04-19,2021,4,Lab vs Mined - that is the question 🧐,"I recently started looking at diamond engagement rings. We found a pear lab diamond that is 2.65 carats, E, and VS1 for around 11k versus a similar mined diamond that would be in the 35-45k range. We could get a similar weight mined diamond with worse clarity and color for less, but it doesn’t seem like there’s any point. Because even if the mined diamond retains 50% of its value and the lab diamond retains 0% of its value, you are still spending more lost money on the mined diamond. In this example, if the diamond is 40k and retains 20k of value, you’re still “losing” 20k versus 11k for the lab diamond. So why on earth would I ever buy mined???

I asked if they actually meant ""simulated"" white sapphire and they were pretty adamant that no, these were actually white sapphires. They doubled down and said lab created stones don't pass the fog test.

I smell BS. If these are actually lab-grown, then it should have the same chemical composition as a natural sapphire no? Or am I misunderstanding?


Edit: if y'all know another sub for jewelers, please let me know as well!

Should I lean towards a 3mm vs 3.5 Franco?  (My choice on plain is that it is smoother and wont snag/pull hair versus diamond cut)

The UArizona Alfie Norville Gem and Mineral Museum has opened in the Historic Pima County Courthouse in Tucson, Arizona!!!

It's best to click on and view the actual images where the article is pretty clear. I

I hope this post is appreciated for what it is . It is not self promotion. The attached article is OC from the Mineralogical Society of Arizona (Phoenix). It announces the opening of the UAANGMM (or ""The Alfie"" as I like to call it). This museum was designed by the same folks that designed the recent remodel of the American Museum of Natural History Mineral Hall in NYNY. That's the mineral hall that is home to the Singing Stone, the 3.6 ton (3,300kg) azurite-malachite block mined at Bisbee, Arizona in the 1890s and exhibited at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, IL, USA.

Come see the re-creation of a Bisbee Stope, the Gem Gallery, the Planetary Mineralogy Hall, the crystal lab.

I hope you enjoy the article and more importantly the wonderful new Alfie soon.

Come see the UAANGMM, any time of year would be great, but I suggest during the September Gem Show or the Weekend of February 14th, when other interesting Gem and Mineral stuff is happening in the Tucson vicinity.

The Alfie is a real Gem.

Discussion!,"In my time lurking and participating in diamond subs like this one and the ones related to it I’ve seen this phenomenon discussed a handful of times. That when evaluated in direct sunlight or under harsh and overhead synthetic light a diamond may appear darker or steely. And that these types of light settings generally aren’t the best for evaluating a diamond you may be considering. Over the past couple of years I’ve worn three rings with larger center stones in various lighting and have been observant how they look in these different settings. They are all different shapes, and my experience has been that they don’t all behave the same way in these harsher light situations. I found that they differed the most under direct sunlight and under harsh synthetic lighting, whereas in most other situations they’d all look similar (white and clean and sparkly). 


So I would like to hear what your experiences are; both anecdotal and expert input would be fun to hear! I have mainly read about this phenomenon in rounds so I’m wondering if the shape of the stone plays a role or perhaps other factors?


Finally, I’ll add some comparison videos of the three stones I’ve been comparing. I’ll add the specs at the bottom as well.

**The good:** Tests as a diamond using a Diamond Selector II. The weight measurements seem to check out using calipers *(measured: 5.55mm x 5.03mm x 5.10mm)* and a gram scale with 0.1g readability *(measured: 0.3g.. so rounded up to 1.5ct)*.

**The bad:** Cracks are visible on the surface, especially around the edges and especially under magnification. Color is a vibrant blue when viewing straight at the crown, when tilted from the side the coloring looks mostly absent of blue *(I read* [*here*](https://lotuscolors.net/how-to-recognize-naturally-colored-diamonds/) *this was indicative of irradiation)*.. I also read blue diamonds are only found in three mines, none of which are from Canada.

Probably it's safe to rule out that this is an untreated blue diamond. I'm thinking it's a 1.35ct natural diamond with some cracks that has been irradiated and is now blue. It may or may not be synthetic. So with that said...

**Question 1:** If it's treated, what's the ballpark retail value as a range for something like this?

**Question 2:** Same question but for a synthetic.

**Question 3 &amp; 4:** Same as questions 1 &amp; 2 but wholesale value instead of retail.

I ordered the 1 carat total weight (0.5 each earring) version of this with platinum setting. 


https://www.jamesallen.com/earrings/diamond-stud-earrings/platinum-double-prong-diamond-stud-earrings-100-ctw-h-i-si1-si2-item-67613


I got the cheaper natural diamond version. Total price was ~$2,400 + tax


I’m firm on not getting synthetic, the girl I’m with seems like the type who wouldn’t be down.


With the purchase I was aiming to impress a little bit but also wanted them to be okay for everyday wear. I was between this size and 0.75 Carat weight but figured you only live once. At the risk of sounding like I’m humble bragging, the girl they are for is very petite (under 5 foot) so I’m a bit worried they may be too big, if anyone has an opinion on that.


I’m also curious how much I could realistically save with a reputable online dealer if I put in effort? I saw ~0.50 carat stones on ritani for about $500 so it seems like it would be relatively straightforward to save $1000 if I wanted? Like 2 stones + setting cost.

I cannot find good info on lattice structure differences, just “they are the same” from random sites but no academic sites. The one thing I’ve found is from GIA labs. 

GIA says natural diamonds grow in an FCC structure and physically with an octahedral shape. It goes on to say that HPHT diamonds form octahedral and cubic faces both in their formation. It then says that CVD diamonds grow flat and up like a cube or box with no cubic or octahedral faces. 

Does this mean they would have different lattice structures? Or would this mean physically they grow different, but providing the diamonds are pure (no other elemental impurities) then the lattice is the same?",4,4,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamonds/comments/11qgted/diamond_lattice_structure_senior_thesis/

As long as it’s sparkly and durable, I’m good. I’m celebrating a milestone (graduating with a masters!) so my brain is fried and I am having a hard time deciding what is best.

I know I’d like a yellow gold setting with 1/4 carat size lab Diamond-just prefer that small size for everyday use. At first I thought I wanted a 3 prong setting with a long, tapered bail, as pictured. Suddenly 3 prong settings look like weird shapes to me today. Now after pondering how Tiffany’s styles their Diamond solitaires with 4 prongs on a short straight bail, I’m rethinking. Will the Tiffany way of setting stand the rest of time?  

Speaking of which, if using Stuller settings-or any other company jewelers commonly source from-what would be the best 4 prong setting to imitate the Tiffany one? Tiffany’s are not quite claw, but they don’t seem standard, either.

I'm from South Africa (the home of de Beers,  where the majority of diamonds are mined) and can tell you that the ""blood diamond"" scare is a marketing tactic designed to get people into stimulants. If your fiance is going to buy your ring on the black market then you have reason for concern. But if he buys one from a reputable jeweller there is little such risk.  Many people don't know this but the diamond on your engagement ring can be officially traced back to the source where it was mined (even if it has been cut several times since then).  In fact for bigger stones &gt;2ct insurance companies often insist on seeing this paper trail before they will insure the ring/payout if it gets stolen.  

I'm a guy and if my future fiancee doesn't want a diamond then that would be a major problem (not a deal breaker, but something we will have to be counseled about). *In fact, I don't believe in the girlfriend being involved in picking the ring herself*.  I'm very traditional on some things and marriage is one of them - I'm Catholic and we believe marriage is a lifelong Sacrament in which I'm supposed to love her as Christ loves the Church - he gave *everything* for his bride, setting the standard Christian men should follow.  

That the rings (e+w) are a personal choice for the woman is, even more B/S  - If my girlfriend doesn't already know that I'm completely committed to her and that she's the third most important person in my life (God,  mom,  her) she has no reason saying ""yes"" to me, no matter what stone I propose with.  *The ring is not to demonstrate my feelings for her, it's to demonstrate that to other people*. 

What if I have a family heirloom that I want to pass on (and I do), does that mean she gets to disrespect the traditions of my family, to avoid being labeled a ""money-honey""? The Moissanite is not an investment (they're overpriced because most are lab grown and lose their value the moment I put it on her finger), not something that's nearly as durable as a diamond (very few people understand the Mohs scale), and certainly not something that can be passed down over the generations.

In the realm of [men's jewelry](https://www.mensskull.com/Mens-Rings), two popular choices stand out: sterling silver and titanium steel. While both materials have their merits, today, we're going to delve deep into why it's healthier for men to opt for sterling silver rings over titanium steel counterparts.

[Sterling silver rings for men](https://www.mensskull.com/Mens-Rings) has adorned the fingers of gentlemen for centuries. Its timeless elegance and lustrous appearance make it a top choice among men who seek both style and sophistication in their jewelry. Sterling silver rings are crafted from an alloy of 92.5% pure silver and 7.5% other metals, usually copper. This combination lends sterling silver its distinct character and durability.

&amp;#x200B;

[silver rings for men](https://preview.redd.it/p59ycu6yycnb1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=026e06dcbf082ea5d4234c39b9a2ac8141f4bcff)

**Hypoallergenic Properties of Sterling Silver**

One of the standout features of sterling silver is its hypoallergenic properties. For men with sensitive skin or allergies, this is a crucial factor to consider. Unlike titanium steel, which can sometimes cause skin irritations and allergic reactions, sterling silver is gentle on the skin, reducing the risk of discomfort or rashes.

**Durability: Sterling Silver vs. Titanium Steel**

The Battle of Durability

Durability is a paramount consideration when choosing a ring, especially for daily wear. Sterling silver may not be as renowned for its toughness as titanium steel, but it holds its ground impressively well. With proper care and maintenance, a sterling silver ring can withstand the test of time.

**Titanium Steel: The Alternative**

Exploring Titanium Steel's Strengths

Titanium steel, often referred to as ""titanium,"" is another popular choice for men's rings. It's celebrated for its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, making it highly durable. However, the toughness of titanium steel comes with some trade-offs that make sterling silver a healthier choice for many.

**Skin Sensitivity Concerns**

The Itch Factor

While titanium steel is generally considered safe for most wearers, it's not entirely free from potential skin sensitivity issues. Some individuals may experience discomfort or itching when wearing titanium steel rings, especially if they have sensitive skin. In contrast, sterling silver's hypoallergenic nature ensures a comfortable experience for a broader range of individuals.

**Weight Matters**

The Weighty Choice

One of the notable distinctions between sterling silver and titanium steel is their weight. Titanium steel rings tend to be significantly heavier than their sterling silver counterparts. While some men may prefer the substantial feel of a titanium steel ring, others find it cumbersome for daily wear. Sterling silver offers a balanced weight that's both comfortable and stylish.

&amp;#x200B;

[skull rings](https://preview.redd.it/d9gpq2s4zcnb1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea53e3dada7493be9b690fb8fb4eb562693367c6)

**Aesthetic Appeal: Sterling Silver Shines Bright**

The Allure of Sterling Silver

In the realm of aesthetics, sterling silver boasts a unique allure. Its brilliant luster and timeless appeal make it a versatile choice that complements a wide range of styles, from classic to contemporary. Whether you're dressing up for a formal event or going for a casual look, a sterling silver ring effortlessly enhances your overall appearance.

**Versatility in Design**

Infinite Design Possibilities

Sterling silver's malleability allows for intricate and creative designs. Jewelers can craft a wide variety of styles, from simple and elegant bands to elaborate and ornate creations. This versatility means that you can find a sterling silver ring to suit your personal taste and style preferences.

**Maintenance and Care**

Keeping Your Sterling Silver Ring Gleaming

To ensure the longevity of your sterling silver ring, it's essential to provide proper care. Over time, sterling silver can develop a natural patina, which some individuals appreciate for its vintage charm. However, if you prefer a high-gloss shine, regular cleaning with a silver polishing cloth can restore its brilliance.

**Conclusion: The Sterling Choice**

In the battle of sterling silver vs. titanium steel for men's rings, it's clear that sterling silver emerges as the healthier choice for a multitude of reasons. Its timeless elegance, hypoallergenic properties, and comfortable weight make it an excellent option for discerning gentlemen. While titanium steel may have its strengths, the overall package that sterling silver offers in terms of style, comfort, and skin-friendliness makes it the superior choice for men seeking quality in their jewelry.

So, when you're in the market for a ring that combines aesthetics, durability, and comfort, remember that sterling silver shines brightly as the ultimate choice for the modern man.",0,0,0.45,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/16er0aw/why_men_should_choose_sterling_silver_rings_over/

Very new to buying rings and gemstones so just wanted to get some advice if possible as I'm starting to get very confused.

I've found a really nice local jewellers and been working with them to get an engagement ring and I think I found a style I really think my partner will love. It's not the one in the picture but it's the same style with slightly larger stones. I've been quoted:

9ct fairmined ring: £1118

5.5mm green Australian sapphire: £645

Two 4 x 3mm pear shaped lab diamonds: £350 each ( natural at £440)

so £2463 total.

The larger diamonds on the sides would look like this one [https://www.cliftonrocks.co.uk/peach-pink-oval-sapphire-engagement-ring/](https://www.cliftonrocks.co.uk/peach-pink-oval-sapphire-engagement-ring/)

but with the green sapphire instead - That is the same shop I'm currently looking at as well.

My question is - Is that a really high price for the gold? I've had a look around and it seems to vary so much with some other rings in the city being similar and some being much much cheaper. I understand it's fair mined which makes it more expensive which I'd obviously prefer as long as that is the fair price.

Would massively appreciate any advice at all from some of the experts on this sub! I do really like the ring as well if that makes any difference.

After 28 yrs together, we upgraded to the ring of my dreams. 

We had the diamonds sourced and the ring designed and created by our trusted jeweler. 

Imagine our surprise to find both the side diamonds glowing in the dark! One is definitely much brighter than the other, but they both glow orange-ish yellow.

At first hubby was sure it meant the stones were fake, or it is something built in to identify lab-created diamonds. 

We had the diamonds inspected and were told
it is a naturally occurring phenomenon. Our original jeweler as well as the 2nd one inspecting the ring both offered to buy the fluorescing diamonds, but we decided to keep them for now. 

This is an heirloom piece I plan to hand down - should we keep the fluorescing stones or replace them with ones that don’t glow in the dark? There is no haziness to the side stones, and they glow for about 6 or 7 seconds before fading.

The entire process from picking the center stone to delivery was easy and straightforward for me. This is obviously a very nerve wracking process for people buying for the first time. I will go through the steps I went through.

**Step 1: Picking the center stone.**

This was something I did on my own. My girlfriend and I had already discussed her preferences so now I had to do some research on the best quality stone for my budget. Lab grown vs. mined is always a big issue so ask ask ask your partner beforehand. No molecular difference between the two but definitely a price difference. I knew the cut, color, clarity I wanted. I went on the website and found several options within a certain carat range. Weaned out the specific diamond based on the video, report, etc.

**Step 2: Designing the ring.**

Filled out the custom design form because I wanted some modifications that I didn't see in the pre-made settings. Within 1 day I received a reply back with a CAD design. I then asked a million questions which they happily answered. I even spoke to the owner on the phone who explained the process. They are a family business based off of Surat, India where the lab diamonds are grown. They ship the final products to their US office in NYC. The reason their prices are extremely reasonable is that they are the manufacturer. So there's no fee for the middle man.

**Step 3: Payment.**

Once I gave the ok for the final design. I was given a link to the payment page. Had a hiccup with my credit card blocking a large purchase. But resolved with a quick phone call. Total cost less than $6k USD.

**Step 4: Manufacturing and Shipping**

Received update emails throughout the process and the final tracking info via FedEx. They were able to ship to a FedEx office which was more convenient for me. See attached photos of the final products. 

Engagement ring: 3.25 ct Oval, Brilliant/Excellent Cut, D, VVS2, 1.46 with 18k yellow gold pave band, hidden halo and cathedral, 1.8mm thickness

Wedding band: 18k yellow gold, pave, 1.8mm thickness

**Step 6: Proposal.**

I have yet to propose but I am less nervous now knowing the final product looks amazing.

What is your opinion on the analysis below?

CONSUMER ALERT: LAB DIAMOND PRICES ARE CRASHING
  
Consumers Beware. Lab diamond prices are crashing, yet some retailers are pricing them high by comparing them to prices for natural diamonds. Consumers think they are getting a good deal, but they are not. Synthetics trade as low as 98% below the Rapaport Price List for natural diamonds.  
 
Synthetic prices are all over the place. Walmart sells a 3 ct., Round, F-G, VS1-VS2, synthetic diamond solitaire ring for $2,975, while Signet’s Blue Nile sells a similar 3.00 ct., Round, G, VS1 synthetic diamond solitaire ring for $8,190. That’s a 275% difference for the same ring.  
 
Some jewelers are pushing synthetic diamonds because they can make huge profit margins. This won’t last because synthetic diamond prices are crashing to hundreds and even tens of dollars per carat. This is because they are available in unlimited supply.  
  
Whether or not to buy a cheap diamond as an engagement ring is a consumer preference. However, consumers who spend thousands of dollars on synthetic diamonds may be seriously overpaying. Consumers should be aware that synthetic diamonds are not like natural diamonds which are rare and expensive. Synthetic diamonds are not real diamonds. They do not retain value.",6,4,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamonds/comments/180nfld/rapaport_on_lab/

Around a decade ago, I made the decision to sell my OG engagement ring to pay for medical expenses. It killed me, but was for my family's best interests at the time. I've been wearing low-cost, non-diamond replacement rings ever since. But we are now able to comfortably afford to replace it, after dreaming of and designing this ring in my head for years. We picked a vendor, and I finally got the preview of the finished ring today!

I went with a ring loosely inspired by my original ring, but with a vintage, updated twist and a larger center diamond. My original ring was a one carat mined diamond round with a pave halo and band in white gold. I know halos get serious hate now, but I still absolutely adore them 22 years later, and wanted my new ring to have that element of my original. 

The center diamond is 2.63 carat F VS1 super ideal cut lab grown brilliant cut center diamond (8.9 mm) that had an HCA score of 0.9. The accent diamonds are E to F color, and VVS range clarity. The setting is vintage-inspired with millgrain details set in 14k yellow gold. The band is 2.0 mm wide at it's thinnest point, and is 2.3 mm at the diamond &amp; millgrain points. The halo itself measures 15.8 mm across. The ring is a size 6.5 (size 6 finger, but I consistently swell some days, so I sized up).

I fell in love with the diamond and my first i tention was to get that diamond reset on a much simpler solitaire and keep it as an alternative engagement ring. I did some research and this diamond is an old mine cushion cut. Iteasires around 6-5.5mm to 5mm so my guess is it's around 0.8 ct in weight. Again just guessing here, through some research I did on the internet. I have zero knowledge in jewelry I'm just passionate. 
I kept digging and my curiosity led me into finding that thins ring is antique and might trace back to the 18th century. This ring is also insanly huugen it's a size 64mm so it doesn't fit on any of my fingers.
I found a [ similar ring](https://bavier-brook.com/products/victorian-old-mine-diamond-engagement-ring-18k) online too. 
So this led me into appreciating the ring even more and not wanting to damage it or just melt it down and get the stone. Ergo this post.
Shall I:
1. Get the diamond set into a simpler solitaire that would inhance it and replace it maybe by an emerald of the same size and size it down 4 mm to be able to wear it on my index.
2. Just size down the ring to 54 - 55 mm (which idk if it's possible) and wear it as engagement ring.
3. Add small pebbles on the inside of the ring to be able to wear it on my index. The diamond here would mask those of my actual engagement ring. I have a margueritte small diamonds setting.

I'm on a quest to find the perfect rainbow gradient sapphire jewelry, specifically an eternity band and a tennis bracelet. (EDIT, i forgot to mention that my jeweler said these quotes are for NATURAL sapphires since she said they couldn't be done in lab grown) I've been quoted $1500 for a 3mm size 10 rainbow sapphire eternity band and $3000 for a 7.25-inch, 3.5mm rainbow sapphire tennis bracelet by my private jeweler in NYC. However, as I'm quite new to the world of sapphires, I'm wondering if these prices are reasonable or if I should explore other options.

I have a decent grasp of diamond valuation but understanding the pricing nuances of sapphires, particularly rainbow gradient sapphires, is a bit challenging for me. Their value is often in their color intensity, clarity, cut, origin, and size, but I'm especially interested in how these factors influence the price of rainbow sapphires arranged in a gradient.

I'm reaching out with a few questions:

1. What would be a fair market price for a line of rainbow gradient sapphires suitable for a tennis bracelet or eternity ring (size 10)? I'm considering sizes around 2mm, 3mm, and 4mm.
2. For those who have experience in purchasing or handling these unique gemstones, could you share your insights on the cost, sourcing, and overall experience?

Any advice, anecdotes, or information regarding acquisition and pricing would be immensely appreciated. I want to make an informed decision and ensure that I'm paying a fair price.

Can/should I add gold to the engagement ring or get sizers from Amazon? Possible pricing for gold addition/appraisal.***

I got this at auction after all said and done with fees I paid $657 for the set.  **The engagement** was listed as 14k white gold with 3 princess cut main stones with round stone accents tcw 1.0 and can see a 14k with ZE next to it *picture 7*.  **The band** was listed as pave diamond 14k white gold .25 tcw though I can't see a 14k anywhere on it just that tiny JX that is in *picture 10*. 

I did have a chain jewelery store here test and they said they are diamonds though I was afraid to ask if there is a way to tell if lab or natural because I don't know if there is a way to distinguish.

Now I do love it and hope that my boyfriend will use it before the end of 2024 so I can finally call him my fiance. Before that moment happens, I had one main concern.  Obviously, it seems the engagement ring had been sized (I am guessing up?) because it is thinner on the bottom as seen in *picture 8* and compared to the band width in *picture 11*.  

I would be devastated if anything happened like I severely bent it or heck even broke it somehow and lost this one day.  They feel only the tiniest bit loose as in I might be a 5.25 size and these were stated as 5.5 sized.  They rotate easily once on and in *pictures 12 &amp; 13* you can see how the engagement ring lays with no pressure and then if I put pressure from underneath.  It easily moves down the finger if I shake the hand hard but my joint keeps it from falling off so don't know if that is how it should fit.

Should I look for a jeweler to potentially add gold to that area to bulk it up and maybe cause it to fit tighter or am I just being paranoid and its strong/good the way it is?  If I did that, does anyone know what a fair price for something like that is?  Or should I just buy a set of those metal sizers from Amazon and add that on because that may make it fit better and add a little reinforcement so I am not so paranoid I will bend/break it?

I am also looking at getting at least the engagement one appraised by someone who said they don't have to send away, they do it in house and charge $150 for the service/documentation.  I am also wondering if this is reasonable cost wise.

Thank you ahead of time for reading and providing your opinions to someone who just knows know what she thinks is pretty and likes without any in-depth knowledge!

*Ok, ok before I anyone points any of this out and calls me sad for buying my own engagement ring: Yes I bought it because; 1- I have bid with this auction house before so I am known and have an account; 2- I had the savings to get it; 3- I don't work, he does, so he pays for everything [as I am a student] for us so in the end it really was his money since that was savings from a monthly amount he gives me as fun money; 4- We went together and viewed 3 that were up for bidding that were ones I liked and he liked this one best so he had equal input in the choosing.  So hopefully no one will make fun of me like a friend did when I told them the story cuz I was excited at the time I won the bid :/*",11,16,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18wqonq

I got into a discussion with one of the sales ladies about lab diamonds. They don’t sell them there, so I wasn’t surprised to be told that they aren’t real diamonds and are worth nothing. She did admit they’ve seen some for settings and they are beautiful. I looked at some of their settings. They were not outrageously priced. 
Then I went to Zales. I would NEVER buy jewelry there but I was at our mall and knew they had lab diamonds. First time I’ve seen them in real life. The lady told me they are real diamonds and she thought they definitely sparkled more than mined diamonds. I looked at some rings with lab diamonds. Some stones looked nice. Others looked too sparkly, almost fake looking. She said they were all VS2 with a DEF color. She said they all had IGI certification. Their prices were high for rings with stones less than 1 Ct. It was my curiosity that sent me there. Happy I did go. I saw a mined diamond ring and a very similar lab diamond ring side by side. I couldn’t tell the difference. 
So my question is… are some lab diamonds more sparkly than mined ones? Would it be because of cut? Clarity? Color? I think I’d like a warmer diamond. 
Right now I’m leaning toward ordering a diamond from one of the better rated companies (considering Dreamstone or Raad) and going to my local jewelry store for the setting. The setting is the part I worry about most. They do all their work in store and have a great reputation. I’d rather pay a little more for peace of mind.",7,15,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/labdiamond/comments/192zsnq/my_experience_at_2_jewelers_today/

1.55ct Australian round parti sapphire - $4840 (however on the box underneath it said $3200)

For the 'Sundaze' ring with Champagne diamonds half way down the ring band you will be looking at approx $3815 for 18ct yellow gold.

If you would like to add the diamond set underhalo, you would be looking at approximately $4820. This is taking into account 1.2mm diamonds, you may also want to consider 1mm diamonds for a finer look.

197ca5a,jewelry,natural vs lab,1705334809.0,2024-01-15,2024,1,Chinese Vs. Indian Diamonds,"Hey everyone! 

I was wondering if anyone knew if there was any difference between diamonds that are lab grow in India vs China? 

It seems like all the cheap lab grown diamond prices that we see from the varying websites online (loose grown diamonds, StoneAiGo websites, etc) are all Indian grown diamonds. And their certificates also all say “This Laboratory Grown Diamond was created by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) growth process and may include post-growth treatment. Type IIa” 

Whereas all of the Chinese lab diamonds I see all say as grown on the certificates and say “As Grown - No indication of post-growth treatment. This laboratory grown diamond was created by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) growth process. Type IIa” 

The diamonds that I am looking for are 4 carat, F color, VS2 clarity, Ideal cut. 

I’m able to get prices as low as $1,800 from loose grown diamonds and stoneaigo affiliate websites, but when I ask the Chinese makers (starsgem, Provence, tianyu) the lowest I can get them to go is $2,300. 

We all know that usually buying direct from the Chinese makers is much cheaper, so why are they not in this case? 

I’ve been hearing that it’s because the Indian diamonds are made really fast by CVD and then treated with HPHT to make the clarity and color to improve, which can then cause strain, darkness, and other issues which affects the diamonds look and shine, whereas the Chinese diamonds are grown slowly and so don’t need treatment and so don’t have some of the issues I just mentioned. 

The videos of the diamonds I’m getting sent from the Chinese makers look really nice and a lot nicer than what I’m used to seeing, but I don’t know if that’s due to good video taking skills. 

Anyways, my question is, are the diamonds from India for $1,800 with post growth treatment as good as the diamonds from China without post growth treatment for $2,300? 

I know that it depends on the stone and the specs and all that. And you can find good and bad diamonds from both, but I’m just talking about the average diamond without going crazy specific. Given two diamonds with the same specs, would the Chinese one “usually” be better?

I can’t decide what to do. The custom route is stressful to try and piece together myself. I don’t want to just settle for the pendant as it is… $1,200 seems too high for what I would be getting.

🔹Should I have them make a custom piece just like this just larger?

🔹Would it be better to try to find a look-a-like that is the setting size I like? (If that’s possible)

I messaged Sonia on 29/12 through her instagram and she showed me reports for the available lab diamonds in my requested specs. I spent a few days requesting videos of different stones and being very indecisive as the options were only smaller or larger than I originally wanted. Sonia was very patient and accommodated my requests promptly. Eventually I went one on the larger side!

I eventually chose and paid for a stone on 5/1 and the first CAD was ready within the timeframe I was quoted on the 8/1.

I asked for some adjustments to the CAD and Sonia worked with the designer to show me what I asked for but also offered the designers advice for a more cohesive design. We went back and forth on the height of the bridge to accommodate future rings, I was shown multiple variations of the CAD as we figured this out which I really appreciate.

We finalised the CAD on 12/1 and I received preshipment photos and videos on the 24/1.

I mentioned we got it for $5600 plus tax and he was pretty adamant they were lab diamonds. There’s no engraving on the diamonds to indicate that but he was saying based on the quality of the diamonds that this ring should have been like $8k-$10k.

I’d like to get a diamond tennis necklace and bracelet for myself. I’m kinda lost what direction to go?  It’s a big purchase so not really looking to go cheapo on it but also can’t break the bank like crazy. 

I understand these questions might be hard to answer but…

What quality diamond is good/nice/respectable to get in these two jewelry pieces ? I understand there’s basically a price for anyone. Hundreds to 6 figures probably….  I’m ready to drops some stacksss and even a rack+stacks (multiple thousands)…. Maybe like $6k-$13k ish on the two items total ? Not sure if that’s laughable or not (loose range, maybe could go more if it made sense but that’s getting hefty for m)… All I keep hearing in my head is Juelz Santanas line in his song, “All mine Vs1s and 2ssss” (lol)
Now,  he’s a big rapper with big wallet….I don’t suppose I need to spend the money on VS1/2 as a rich rapper does….but I also want a nice and “respectable” diamond quality …..but where’s the line between quality and shrinking quality drawn?

1. Is there like , a line in the sand of diamond quality where you’d say, “Diamond quality X and above are legit but any quality under X begins a significant drop off in quality”.   ??

2. I’m pretty sure I do not want lab diamonds but could be persuaded I suppose? What’s the diamond fan/ jewelry peoples opinion on lab grown diamonds instead of real?


3. How about carats?  Are carats in relation to the actual diamonds or the carets of the metal of the necklace ? (Or both?) how many should I get ? ’d like nice/respectable . I don’t think I want yellow gold necklace but probly white gold?


3. Do you think going to NY diamond district is good/best place for me to go?. Im fairly close to it. 
~ I was planning on going to nY diamond district as I’ve heard this is one of best places in world to get right price ….though I imagine it’s shark infested and could easily get played there too….if going there , any advice , tips or specific areas/shops to consider ? 

4. Any tips for me when shopping /haggling for these items ? 
Do you think it’s best to buy the two items together for best deal?
What to say or not say when there?

1) Besides the serial number, my understanding is that with machinery, there is a detectable difference between minded and lab diamonds. What are these differences? I recall reading some comments about natural diamonds having a ""rings on a tree"" effect from being grown over time, and one referencing the presence of nitrogen. And a comment that natural diamonds are not usually actually 100% pure diamonds. But I'm not sure which of those are true, and whether the difference is detected visually (through specialized equipment, if the tree ring effect is true), or chemically (through natural impurities), or both. 

2) A ring I'm considering says it uses natural diamonds because of the type of cut needed for some of the stones, and I've also heard that lab diamonds are less desirable for step cuts like Asscher cut diamonds. Why is there a difference (or at least a perceived difference) when it comes to certain cuts? Shouldn't a lab diamond have the same ability to be cut as a mined diamond?

** YOU CAN SKIP TO MY QUESTION AT THE BOTTOM**

So I ordered 8 Top solid 14k open face from customgoldgrillz and to make a long story short they were so tight if I would have tried to push them all the way on it would no doubt have broken some teeth.

 No problem though. I sent them back out. The way they fixed them was to add “deep cuts” which essentially means they slice between each tooth to give it a permanent look and also more flexibility.

 I was under the impression they were going to recast new ones for me and scrap mine, and wasn’t happy to see the the same tooth of the grill that didn’t cover all the way up to my gum line, still didn’t cover up to them gum line. That’s how I knew they weren’t re casted. 

So when I sent them back the second time I told them I wanted them on the bottom instead of the top. That way they have to re cast them. No questions. And of course they were very apologetic. I’m not trashing them. So they offered me the deep cuts again for free as well as diamond dust. I don’t like the deep cuts but went with that incase the grillz were too tight again, allowing more flexibility. I also went with the diamond dust finish because I literally thought it was leftover dust from shaving diamonds down sprinkled on the finish XD but all it is is a bumpy texture to catch more sun light. I don’t like how they look. They’re much more dull and really don’t look as good as they first did

**** SKIP HERE FOR MY ISSUE/QUESTION***

So the goal is to get my Grillz from looking dull and rough to shiny and smooth

And my question is, how to achieve this result? Have a jeweler sand down that rough “diamond dust” finish smooth then polish? Or perhaps plating them with another layer of 14k?

AND

Who would offer a service of this nature? Online or in person

Here’s some pics for comparison. The first pic straight off the website is how they used to look. The second pic is how they look now.

Questions:

1. Would this one be considered crushed ice, hybrid, brilliant, or something else?
2. Does it look like the four main pavilion facets extend all the way to the corners, or do they stop short of the corners? I read that hybrid and ""true"" brilliant cuts reach the corners, whereas crushed ice cut stops short.
3. Any overall or specific concerns with this diamond? Anything you think I should be aware of?

The IGI report has it labeled as brilliant, but it seems like there are many variations of cushion cuts, and the only way to really define it is by eyeballing it. I'm looking to avoid the crushed ice cushion look, which I think translates to a cut with less facets, more chunk(?).

I haven’t really been active in the jewelry subs (mainly mom and IVF) but I’ve lurked A LOT and learned about Luvansh from here when researching loose LGD. 

I initially went to Loose Grown Diamonds with an IGI number for an 8.65ct and they were more expensive than William Daniels and Dream Stone but offered to price match. It became tedious with Loose Grown Diamonds (happy to explain why but it’s lengthy so I’m going to skip it here).

I then went to Luvansh but you can’t really search individual stones. I was curious so I used the live chat on their site to ask about the specific 8.65 stone I found. I received a response basically saying ‘we have our own in-store inventory but here’s a list of 9.cts for $XYZ.’

Guys. I was absolutely floored by the price differences so I dove headfirst into working with Luvansh. 

Communication was absolutely stellar. We spent about 15 minutes on the phone and he sent me videos/pictures. Jay even sourced the original 8.65ct that I found through Stonealgo and sent me an in-person video but the price was going to be more expensive (I posted that video in this sub asking for feedback). 

The specs of his 9ct were closer to a visual 9.75ct. I have great fraud/dispute protection with my CC so I bit the bullet and ordered. I asked them to hold off on shipping because I was going to be out of town for Easter. I texted Jay on Monday to confirm shipment and received it at 11am the next day, yesterday (NY to CA). 

I paid $2,800 UNDER what I was quoted from loosegrowndiamond.com and Friendly Diamond. Plus, mine is a bigger stone, both in weight and appearance!

Here are the specs:

I'm getting married the 27th of this month &amp; my bonus daughter (fiance's son's girlfriend) has been very supportive &amp; kind. Over the years we've grown closer to where she started calling me her bonus mom &amp; recently shortened it to ""mom"". She's mentioned wanting matching tattoos (I may or may not be a little too old for that) &amp; she mentioned permanent jewelry, which I had to Google to make sure it wasn't another tattoo offer ;) She is incredibly sweet &amp; I know she loves butterflies. I do too so I thought since she's always worn silver &amp; I've always worn yellow gold, I'd have the jeweler who created my fiance's ring &amp; mine, make this for her. 

It was cast in 14K white &amp; yellow gold &amp; has very tiny magnets in the middle to hold the body together. One day I won't be here &amp; she'll have both pieces. For now, I'll gift her the whole thing the morning of our wedding &amp; she can wear her half. For the wedding, she chose her dress &amp; accessories which included her typical silver jewelry. She asked me a couple weeks ago if it was ok to switch to yellow gold because she thought it would match better. I did too but told her from the beginning whatever she was comfortable with was what she should wear. I really wanted to tell her yellow gold from the beginning but didn't want her to feel uncomfortable. Now gifting her the butterfly, I'll ask if she wants to wear my 1/2 for the wedding. I had her fitted for a proper chain length a couple months ago &amp; recently bought a matching yellow gold, diamond cut rope chain in 1.8mm It's thin enough to be dainty but also strong enough to hold the butterfly. 

I commissioned this piece in Sept last year after we were engaged in July. It was completed in Nov &amp; I've had no one I could trust not to tell her so I thought I'd share with you who seem to have a love &amp; appreciation for unique things. I get to give it to her in 22 days!",21,8,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/1bvup3l/bonus_daughter_butterfly/

I found this diamond and agreed with the store they would hold it for me for a couple days while I mull it over, and I was wondering if this was a good one (have the HIA report below)? It's still very expensive ($28k), but it's a bit cheaper than other comparable ones at the store, so I am not sure if I am missing something or not. Obviously, I'm aware that I am overpaying, but is this at least a very good diamond? Only reason I am wondering is because while I was looking at diamonds, I saw another one in the store which seemed to have a bit more ""fire,"" but the salesperson said they both had the same cut and clarity, and the only difference was that the color of that one was D. The price was also $10k more, which made me hesitant. But I always thought the color around D-F didn't really matter much, at least to the naked eye. So now I'm worried that there is something wrong with the cut of mine and that I should just bite the bullet and go for the more expensive one?

  
Thanks for any help on this! Looking for a ring has been an absolutely nerve-racking process for me, so I might just be paranoid and overthinking.

After a brief surge in diamond jewellery demand during the pandemic, diamond miners are now grappling with an oversupply that is forcing them to reduce the excess inventory.

Prices for lab-grown diamonds will continue to fall over the next year

  
As lab-grown diamonds have been around for decades, their recent surge in popularity prompts the question: why the sudden hype? The increase in supply in recent years has driven down lab-grown diamonds’ retail prices, hence luring buyers with their affordability. “Up until 5, 6, 7 years ago, it was only a little bit cheaper than natural diamond, so nobody really was enthusiastic about it,” Zimnisky said. “But as the price has come down, the demand has definitely grown with the relative decrease in price.” The price gap between a 1-carat lab-grown diamond and its natural counterpart widened from 10% in 2016 to as much as 80% by 2022, [according](https://www.paulzimnisky.com/Lab-Diamond-Sales-Grow-as-Prices-Fall) to Zimnisky. Additionally, lab-grown diamonds also hit another sweet spot: they are ""visually indistinguishable"" nowadays to the naked eye, says Moran, even for seasoned diamond dealers like himself.

I’m finding myself too in my head during this process and I would love some advice, opinions and any other information you feel I could benefit from. 

I’m looking for an elongated cushion, antique cut, with a ratio of at least 1.5 (or above). I have very long fingers and a big hand, and I like the look of a longer stone. A lot of the antique elongated cushions I’ve seen are still too “square” or “stumpy” for my liking. 

I have attached some inspiration pictures from what I’ve seen online. NYC jeweler Hamra Diamonds has a lot of the style, yet they are all mined diamonds. I’ve also recently found Fiorsee, and would love some firsthand feedback from anyone who has bought from them. 

Custom cutting a diamond - is this a terrible idea? If I hate it, tough luck because I would have to pay for it regardless.

I argue she should keep her current diamond and get a lab because no one will ever know and that ""status"" she seems to seek is kind of over anyways due to all the labs. 

My mother (79f) still has these desires of having a huge honking diamond on her finger. She and my dad (80m) have been married over 50 years, and I believe she is already on her third upgrade. Her current stone is a round, natural and 2.7 or 2.8 carats. Its color, cut, and clarity are all highly graded, but I can't remember what they are. My dad is a scientist-minded doctor, and I know he did a lot of research on this back when they bought it about 25-30 years ago. It is beautiful, but I think my mom always (not-so-secretly) wished it were over 3 carats. 

Anyway, I got in this discussion with them yesterday when she casually brought up again that she wanted a bigger diamond. I told her to get a lab. My dad said he's priced the size/type she wants in natural and they are well over $100k. I told her that is INSANE and that buying a natural stone that expensive is ludicrous and doesn't even hold the cache that it used to due to lab diamonds. They would probably trade in her current diamond in order to purchase this new one which, to me, makes no sense. They could keep the old one and buy a lab with the exact specs she wants for WAY less than the difference of trading her old diamond. My mom wants natural because, well, just because she's old, I guess. My dad, understanding that lab and natural are chemically identical, also thinks natural is a waste of money. It's weird because this is the only area in her life that my mom cares about this kind of stuff. She buys the majority of her clothes at Costco or Talbots, she has never purchased a designer bag in her life, she drives a Toyota, etc.... In a lot of ways I feel like, who cares, she doesn't have a ton of time left, let her just get what she wants. But the practical (and poor) side of me can't help but argue with her about this. I guess it should be noted that I am and will never be in the same financial situation as my parents. I married a fireman and we're broke, so that might also color my judgement, lol. Probably should also be noted that I'm my mother's only daughter and no matter what the diamonds will likely go to me, so I don't fully know what I'm fighting for. Haha! 

So what are your thoughts, diamond people? Am I stupid to try to discourage this or should I just get over it and help my dad find the perfect (ridiculously) expensive diamond for my mom whom I love?

Sorry for the crappy quality on the photos, it's so hard to photograph a loose diamond without tweezers!

I'm panicking slightly, I can't tell if it's just the bright light really bringing out the 'maltese cross contrast' in the middle, or if the stone is poorly cut and I completely missed noticing this under the bright lights of the showroom. It was from a really well reviewed store so I'm hoping for the best. Appreciate it 🙏🏻

I took the ring to a local well-reviewed jeweler (we are new to the area; the jeweler we bought the ring from originally is in another state) who said that they were unable to match the original detail and suggested a custom recreation of the setting on my existing ring. We didn’t realize how much this was going to take to replace the diamond (our own fault for not investigating originally). My question is: if I let the jeweler update the ring to replace the diamond, will it look broken and welded back together? Or are most jewelers worth their salt capable of recreating something like this? The setting is platinum. There are tiny diamonds in the setting as well as the band. My husband and I have tossed around the idea of having a whole new ring created so we don’t have to chop mine up but I’m worried about the cost of this getting out of hand.

“As part of an initiative it began testing last spring, The Clear Cut has begun offering a two-carat round lab-grown diamond for free with the purchase of any mined diamond ring. It’s an evolution of a service the brand already provided, offering customers a free cubic zirconia replica of their ring to wear while traveling so their real diamond ring can remain safe from theft or loss. Thanks to the falling price of lab-grown diamonds, The Clear Cut can now offer real diamonds as a free travel replacement for all of its rings, according to the company.”

““Both products will coexist, and neither will go away,” Landau said. “Lab-grown can be a great replacement for cubic zirconia or moissanite — things that are meant to replicate diamonds — and they can be great fashion pieces. Then you can keep natural diamonds for the things you pass down.””

Anyone else rolling their eyes at the diamond industry’s marketing ploys? Any other thoughts? I feel like the owner of The Clear Cut is basically trying to suggest that lab diamonds are worthless trinkets.

Inspired by some posts, I pulled the trigger on a ""Maltese cross"" old mine cut style cushion at Loosegrowndiamond. Was a bit nervous because of mixed reviews, but the diamond arrived a week(!) after I ordered with free shipping and approx. measurements check out. I can also see the girdle inscription, but haven't yet found my loupe to double check. The diamond was half the price of what it was listed for at Ritani, so for now I'm really happy with the purchase! Their tracking could be improved though, since on the website my order isn't even confirmed yet.

I would like to set it in east-west style   bezel, attach the chain on both sides and wear it as a bracelet. Local jewelers are quite terrible, but I'm unsure if the likes of Starsgem or Fiorese can make the setting only based on measurements? Has anyone of you ordered bezel settings from overseas? Or can someone suggest an easier to create setting style that won't get constantly snugged on clothing?

He paid a significant markup for the diamond because the jeweler promised meticulous curation and inspection of every diamond in their inventory. This was all done online, as we were located on the East Coast. In every photo and video she sent, the diamond did not appear to have a bow tie. 

Due to some events in our lives, we weren't able to get engaged until June of this year, which was also the first time I saw the ring in person. Upon seeing the ring, I immediately noticed a bowtie effect in the diamond, but I reassured myself that this was typical of oval-shaped diamonds. Although the bowtie was visible in various lighting conditions and bothered me, I tried to accept it as a normal characteristic.

Recently, my friend got engaged, and when comparing her ring to mine, I noticed just how significant my bowtie effect is. Her diamond is on a solitaire band, while mine is on a pavé band. Additionally, my diamond seems somewhat ""grey shaded,"" even though both diamonds are colorless and mine is one grade higher than hers. Shouldn't mine theoretically appear ""whiter""?

Given that it has been almost a year since my fiancé purchased the ring, is it worth reaching out to the jeweler to express my concerns? Am I overthinking this, or does my diamond actually have a significant bowtie and appear grey?",21,48,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1e1jvn1

I LOVE jewelry and I’ve been fortunate enough to wear and care for some incredible pieces. Just a little bit of background, most of the jewelry I wear is from my mom’s collection. I usually borrow things for a few years and exchange them back with her (she’ll let me have anything I want but I prefer to see myself as a temporary steward). We both love our baubles. My late dad was an art dealer so that’s part of how they built their collection.

 
**Engagement ring:** Mine! lol. Custom made, 18K, no idea on the carat or type of diamond but I adore it. 

**Middle finger:** (Mom’s)James Avery marked, 14k, “D 73” on inside of band. Probably a blue topaz, no idea of the year or size/weight of the stone. 

**Ring finger:** (Mom’s) Alexandrite (probably synthetic but I’ll pretend my family balls like that), 14K marked, year unknown. I call it my tree trunk ring. It changes from a beautiful smoky purple to a sea-foam green.

**Right hand:** (Mom’s) this is a fun one! I asked my mom and she said it’s from “the Estate of Dixie Jones” an heiress who lived in Dallas at some point.
I think my parents would’ve bought this early 90s. 
Sapphire, pink diamonds, diamonds, rubies, 14K marked. Suture on band from a previous size adjustment (I’m assuming this), face of a woman on the sides. Year and maker unknoooown.

1e8wstp,Diamonds,mined diamond,1721596440.0,2024-07-21,2024,7,An explanation of the different types of Cushion Cut diamonds from Cushion Modified Brilliants to  Cushion Brilliants to Old Mine Brilliant Cushion,"This is a short article that explains the difference between the various types of cushion cut diamonds as it's a question that's been asked many times of the forum here.

https://preview.redd.it/oi643q1ztxdd1.jpg?width=1640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad155983f38727c9e6cc2fd741900e4ece545292

Cushion cut diamonds' appearance can vary quite a bit within a cushion outline as their facet pattern is not as standardized as a modern round brilliant diamond. A modern round brilliant (MRB) features a very specific facet pattern with 57 facets. This is not the case with cushions. There are many different facet patterns within the ""cushion cut"" shape umbrella with each facet pattern resulting in a different appearance. In fact, the main difference between a cushion modified and a cushion brilliant are the pavilion facets. Cushion brilliants achieve the non crushed ice effect by basically reproducing the pavilion facet pattern of a round brilliant diamond. Cushion modified brilliants modify the pavilion facets from a round by adding additional faceting to the pavilion, typically to retain additional weight or increase the yield of a rough diamond. For this reason, cushion brilliant diamonds will typically have a better spread to cushion modifieds as they don't include the additional facets which retain weight.

We tend to categorize cushions into three categories.

1- **Modern cushions with the crushed ice effect**. Cushion Modified Brilliants.

2- **Modern cushions without the crushed ice effect**. Usually Cushion Brilliants but also some cushion modified brilliants.

3- **Vintage cushions also without the crushed ice effect**.

The term ""crushed ice effect"" denotes the visual of a diamond when  the specific facets of a diamond can't be discerned by the naked eye. This effect is caused by ""virtual facets"" created in the diamond from secondary and tertiary reflections of light inside the diamond. Virtual effects in and of themselves refract light more weakly and therefore these types of diamonds are typically less bright than diamonds with better design characteristics. On a positive note, they can have great fire.

To complicate things even more each of these categories includes subsets of facet patterns. As an example, modern cushions (without crushed ice) can include a few facet patterns such as a ""four main pavilion"" cushion (sometimes termed X Factor) and an ""eight main pavilion"" cushion and others with each giving off a slightly different type of appearance.

In the vintage cushion world, the faceting can vary slightly. The term ""Old Mine Brilliant"" is used on a GIA lab report only when a few specific criteria are met. These criteria have to do with table, crown, lower half and culet proportions. It is possible to have a diamond look just like a vintage, old mine brilliant while still being termed a ""cushion brilliant"" in a GIA lab report.

I think it's important for consumers to be aware of the different options and to choose the type of faceting that speaks to them the most while making a decision ""eyes wide [open.as](http://open.as) ther",17,3,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamonds/comments/1e8wstp/an_explanation_of_the_different_types_of_cushion/

The ring is beautiful but it’s so much more steepled than it looked in the photos. It doesn’t sit nicely with my engagement ring and it’s so tall it’s hitting the bottom of my knuckle. The version of my ring shown on the website has a longer diamond where mine is closer to equal width and height, so that could be why it looks so extreme but I don’t think that’s it.

I thought it was maybe me just being bad at visualizing but on the website the thin strips of diamonds seem to come out at a 90 degree angle from each other but mine is closer to 45 degrees.

Am I just being a perfectionist and expecting too much from a hand made piece or is it reasonable for me to ask for this to be corrected?

A few months ago I received my upgrade ring. Elongated cushion 3.36 , 1.3 ratio H VS1. I really spent time looking around and my local jeweler sourced several stones and finally settled on this particular one. My issue is I feel like it’s so huge on me and I feel like it looks very…rectangular and not pillowy. Like almost masculine? In photos it looks pillowy but in person it doesn’t. I have to wear it with a band bc I feel like it helps mask how huge it is. It didn’t feel that large to me when it was just a loose stone but once it was set I was like 🥴

 I feel silly complaining bc it’s a beautiful stone and ring but I just feel it’s not me. I wish I had gone with an oval or slightly larger pear. Or maybe a smaller cushion? My original ring which I have kept is an earth mined pear (I can’t remember the exact specs) but I think it’s around 1.8 carats? I figured I would go for something different since I had a pear but slightly regretting that now. Anyway I’m attaching pics and videos. Not sure I can even trade in for a different stone at this point- probably not worth selling either. For reference my ring size is 4.5. If you’ve made it this far, thanks for listening to me ramble and complain!  (If you check my post history I believe there are some videos- wasn’t able to add here)

I have never purchased a diamond before. The only diamond I owned prior to these purchases was a 1ct. natural mined diamond my husband bought to propose to me with 18 years ago. I have a small moissanite ring collection that fulfilled my magpie desires…until I found out how affordable lab diamonds had become. Enter this sub and the world of online diamond shopping. 

I found Luvansh through this sub. I was originally looking for a pear to replace a pear moissanite in a ring I love. I got distracted by the ovals and ended up purchasing a 1.84 ct. H oval for an incredible price. I literally thought it was too good to be true, and I was probably getting scammed. I took the chance and purchased it anyway. Before ordering, I called to verify their return policy and spoke to Jay. He reassured me that I could return the stone if I didn’t like it. I pulled the trigger and waited. They advertise overnight shipping on their website, but I ordered around 6 PM so I did not expect it to ship until the next day. Well, it did not ship the next day. On the third day, I called to ask what was going on and apparently there was a shipping mishap. Jay called me back and offered me a small discount for the delayed shipping. I received my stone a few days later. I thought it was beautiful and planned to take it to my jeweler to verify but she was out of town. So I went back to Luvansh and found the pear I was originally after and bought it 😂. This time there was no problem with the shipping and I received it two days later. Another beautiful stone at an amazing price. 

I waited to post this review until I was able to see my jeweler. She checked both of the stones today and verified they were indeed real diamonds and that they were very nicely cut stones. She couldn’t believe the price I paid for them!  I’m so excited for my new projects and to have affordable diamonds. Moissanite are great, but there’s just something about a diamond that’s incomparable. I have told  several young people who are looking to get engaged soon but can’t afford expensive rings about Luvansh and lab diamonds. It’s wonderful they have this option, and I wish it was available back when I got engaged.  ",10,13,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1egzsy1

I have known from the beginning I heard about them, I wanted Lab. I feel like we are in the middle of the shift between old and new diamond ideals and stereotypes and here is what I mean. 

Since we can now get diamonds as big as you want, do you care people can assume they are lab? Especially if your partner is not affluent or successful? And what is the point of their accessibility if we dampen ourselves and go small to fit our “economic standing.”

Even people that love lab diamonds, and want bigger rocks, (because you can do that now how cool! So why not???) still say things like “oh don’t go to big you don’t want it to look fake” or “if it doesn’t match your partners salary people will know for a fact it’s not mined.” 

I’m torn. I know that ethically and cost-wise I LOVE lab grown!!!! But a small part of me does wonder about the judgment.. my partner works at a restaurant and he wants to get me a huge diamond (love him so much.) and that is guaranteeing people will “know.” But also who gives a fuck? 

Because ultimately we have the technology now that allows anyone to enjoy pretty sparkly diamonds and there is no longer a massive paywall BUT we all know how people love to gatekeep their luxuries so I think some people throwing fits about labs stems from jealousy and no longer feeling special anymore because more people get to enjoy it and also own a big sparkly ring(womp womp)!!

If anyone asked me “is it real” I would say YES and maybe not even elaborate, because it is a real diamond. Just like IVF babies are real humans and ice from the fridge is still ice!

I took marketing in college so I already know the fact that the mined diamonds are a manufactured value, falsely created supply and demand scam lol. So even more reasons again to not fall for that!

Basically I’m asking what is your outlook on this? Go as big as you want because you can or hold back and go middle road so “people can’t tell.”

I currently have a modest marquise family diamond set in yellow gold, and a simple yellow gold band to match, though I often wear a plain 3mm platinum band on its own. I would like a ring in white gold or platinum to have an option with some sparkle. I am flexible on price up to about 3k, and vaguely am caught between wanting a half or 3/4 eternity for hella sparkle, or a more engagement style ring with a center stone. 

I love how ‘deep’ diamond feels when looking closely, but also love the more rainbow flash of moissanite. I don’t have enough experience to know which cuts suit the different stone qualities when everything else is the same. For example, is a moissy or diamond going to look better in an emerald cut? How about antique cuts like OMC? Ovals? Does the size of the stone change your answer? Help me narrow this list because the paradox of choice has me frozen 😮‍💨

I was also considering a hidden halo, or a regular halo. I have a few questions about the process.

First of all, can it be done? I’m assuming it could. 

Would there be a price difference in using lab diamonds or mined diamonds if I use a halo? I’m thinking there may not be. I have a beautiful right hand ring with a large lab diamond, and I love it. But I’m not sure if it’s good to mix lab and minded diamonds on the same ring.

Do you think either type of halo would look right with this ring and if so, which type? 

And how much do you think it would cost approximately getting a new head with some type of halo?

Each program came with a little bag that contained a cubic zirconia and a numbered ticket—except for one, which contained an actual, non-lab-grown 1-carat diamond donated by a well-known local jeweler. And lo and behold, when the winning ticket was announced, I realized it was mine and I was holding a real-ass diamond in my hand.

A representative from the jeweler was present at the event. Earlier in the program, he had said that the diamond was worth $3,000–$4,500, and that whoever won it could bring it to his establishment and they'd work with the winner on coming up with a nice setting for it.

The thing is, my fiancée already has her engagement ring and wedding band, and really doesn't desire any more expensive jewelry at the moment. At the risk of sounding mercenary, what we really need right now is cash. For the past four years, she's been locked in a brutal legal battle with her very wealthy and very vindictive ex-husband over custody of their three teenage daughters. The legal fees have mounted to the point where we're barely covering our household expenses some months; we've even talked about selling my car or moving into a smaller house.

So I'm trying to figure out how to get maximum value out of this diamond. And I'm wondering whether it would be incredibly gauche to go back to the jeweler, tell him about our situation, and see if he'd be willing to buy the diamond back from us. Clearly he was hoping to get some additional business from whoever won the diamond, which is completely reasonable and I don't begrudge him that at all—but again, my fiancée and I are focused more on our financial needs right now than having something sparkly to hang around her neck. If going back to that same jeweler is a bad idea, is there some other way we could monetize it without selling it to some pawn shop for pennies on the dollar?

The lab grown equivalent costs 5% or less and ""looks"" and ""is"" exactly the same.... no salesperson in the universe could convince a buyer that spending £50k on a 5ct cushion diamond vs. £1.2k is a good thing just because it is ""natural"".

1f47uwr,Diamonds,mined diamond,1724951567.0,2024-08-29,2024,8,60/60 oval diamond and AGS Ideal,"Hello,

I have pulled the trigger on an oval lab diamond with a table of 60% and a depth of 60.1%. Initially I was looking at a table smaller than the depth, probably around 58% for 62% depth. 

I have to mention, for some reason I was not able to view the diamond and bought it online. Most of those diamonds were IGI certified, but I could not really find the correct carat in there stock, then this one came up with a GIA and AGS Ideal 0 cert. 

Although the 60% table seemed a bit big, and it came at a premium because of the certifications, I bought it thinking the AGS light performance test will guarantee a beautiful diamond. It is 1.17ct VVS1 D, GIA EX.

Fast forward, I now have found out about the 60/60 concept, which kind of make me doubt about my decision. A friend of mine that work for a jeweler told me I overthink, lab diamond a pretty much all the same.

Anyway, a few questions: 
-Does the 60/60 rules apply the same for oval diamond?

-Does an AGS ideal 0 report (see picture) guarantee that this is a well cut 60/60? I am a bit scared of losing fire and sparkle.

-Does the AGS light report guarantee that the crown angle are good? Asking since neither the GIA or AGS cert mention any of those metrics.

-Do I still have more chances that the diamond will be a higher quality than an IGI EX at what could have been a lower price? 

- And at last, what do you think of the ASET?

I have a feeling I am indeed overthinking, it’s in my nature to try to find the best I can but sometimes I go a bit too far. Maybe I just need a bit of reassurance.

#The diamond I selected ✅

Hi guys! I just had a custom lab diamond made to my exact specifications and wishes. It is an oval ‘Hearts and Arrows’ diamond with the most precise cut. Unique for an oval! It has extremely good light performance and contrast. 

The GCAL certification just came in. GCAL's online certificate with all scans and video's can be [found here](https://www.gcalusa.com/certificate-search.html?certificate_id=342270004). The fire video is unreal. 😇

* Shape: Oval X 
* Measurements: 7.53 x 5.57 x 4.62 
* Carat Weight: 1.35 
* Color: F
* Clarity: VVS1 
* Cut: 8X GCAL certified 

And the special feature is that the ratio of the diamond is 1:35. So it is less round, and more oval. Which is even harder to get right. I do really wonder what you think of it. 😁

#How can you select a good cut oval diamond?💍 

**GIA and IGI are not that helpful, and they know it**

GIA and IGI do NOT asses the cut of an oval diamond. Polish and Symmetry say little to none about cut quality! There is NO indicator. There is no way of seeing the light performance. And vendors know that, so most of them just produce big, bad/medium cut stones because that is easy money. 

**GCAL is way better**

GCAL 8x certification does include fire, scintillation, ASET, proportions, etc. AND has all the scans available online. Even a video of the fire. 

As GCAL 8x certification is more expensive and shows a lot more of the diamond, therefore it is mostly used for better quality diamonds with a better cut quality. They just want to show off! A bad cut would be very easy to spot. AND STILL…..

GCAL 8x certification does not guarantee that the bowtie effect is non-existent. [Here](https://www.gcalusa.com/certificate-search.html?certificate_id=LG341490528) is a GCAL 8x certified oval that does not have Hearts and Arrows and has a little bowtie effect. But it is already a cut above most diamonds! This certification is not easy to get!

**Look for H&amp;A in the GCAL ASET-scope**

So the best way to asses the cut quality is by looking for Hearts &amp; Arrows. They only appear in the very very best cut diamonds. The pattern is visible in the ASET-scope. And ASET is included in the GCAL 8X certification. So this a breakthrough! 😁

We have a plan! Look for GCAL and look at the ASET scope for H&amp;A. But if this only appears in the very very best cut diamonds.. and the industry creates big, bad/medium cut stones.. there aren’t many fish in the see. 🐟

**Oval H&amp;A specific vendors**

So how are we going to fix this? How do you find the best ones? Simple, you let somebody else do it and pay a little more. The best way to find a H&amp;A oval is by looking at a specific reseller. Or actually, a creator of H&amp;A ovals. Because there are only two of them. 

• I bought mine at JannPaul. Made to order. Really liked the process.

• [Brian Gavin](https://www.briangavindiamonds.com/products/1-54-e-vs1-brian-gavin-signature-oval) has some as well.

**Simple buying tips, things that are not going to help**

And please note.. picking a better colour is not going to give a badly cut diamond more fire, sparks and scintillation. A untrained eye cannot assess the colour of a G or maybe F and higher. 💎

And it is very unlikely that you can spot the inclusions in a VVS2 diamond. So why pay for a VVS1? This is also not going to give a better sparkle. ✨ 

The most important thing is the cut quality. And it can be like 60% of the price of the diamond. The better the cut, the better it looks. 👀",11,29,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/labdiamond/comments/1f4qrk3/what_do_you_think_oval_135_ratio_hearts_arrows/
1f50wla,labdiamond,mined diamond,1725038717.0,2024-08-30,2024,8,LGD (Loose Grown Diamonds) Review,"While I know that this subreddit and others have reviews of LGD, I figured that one extra review wouldn’t hurt for future ring/diamond shoppers. 

Initially: 
- I had research this sub, and a few others, and saw that there were some mixed reviews about ordering a ring from there. The reviews for a loose diamond were glowing. So I had figured that mine wouldn’t be that bad. 

During: 
- I ran into a post, and I met a user (Panda) underneath that post that I was able to DM and ask about her experiences with LGD. She reassured me that I would not be scammed, as the OP in the post where we first interacted wondered about how long it usually takes for them to produce and ship their rings. During this time, she (Panda) messaged me and sent me pictures of the craftsmanship at LGD, and how despite her sending it back multiple times to get fixed, 6 months were wasted and she ended up having to go to another jeweler. 

Now: 
- My fiancé and I received the diamond last night. And upon inspecting the ring, I just realized that I was not one of the lucky few that had a nice ring made. When they first sent the CAD, I had asked Susan (their customer support rep) to ensure that the prongs wouldn’t be too bulky, which she assured me that would not be. Despite that, the prongs came incredibly bulky; also, my family, friends , and I found that the ring was a bit crooked? Lastly, despite ordering it in 14k gold, the gold wasn’t gold? (I don’t know if that made sense or not). Thus, we’ve decided to immediately email her to start a refund. 

Thus, if you were to buy a loose diamond from them, they’re great! (Though the website can be laggy.) As for a setting/ring, I’d highly recommend other jewelers if possible. 

TLDR: Loose diamonds from LGD are great, but please reconsider if you’re wanting a ring from them. 

First 2 pictures are of Susan’s email response to us and the picture she included of our ring during quality check. The others are ones my fiancé took last night.

I have other wedding sets that are smaller for when I want to be more subdued in my jewelry choices, but I'm really enjoying taking this one out on the town!  I love that top quality labs are now attainable -- if this finished ring were made of mined diamonds, it would be in the six figures, and so very far beyond my means!

1fhybj0,jewelry,mined diamond,1726469603.0,2024-09-16,2024,9,Help us pick a wedding set please!,"Hi!

So my husband and I have been happily married for 5 years now ❤️ he proposed to me with a beautiful diamond halo ring back in 2018.
Pic below is very similar to my engagement ring (I am at work and did not have a good pic of my ring)😅
When we got married we had our wedding rings ready to go. A simple, but classic white gold set. Nothing dramatic or special. His was a bit wider, mine had a small diamond in the band. They were engraved as well. I never wear my engagement ring on the daily, because I work in the oil and gas industr, and a big ring would be unsafe, and also I would be scared to damage or lose it.
But I did wear my wedding band a lot. Until it got damaged. It just keeps getting smushed and misshapen. I have had the jeweller correct it many times, but I am getting tired of it now. And now my husband ( who lost a lot of weight recently) lost his wedding band 🙈😅
Now, we have the opportunity to get a new set!
And although I liked the set we had, I want something different now. I am realising that white gold ( or maybe gold in general) is too soft for me. I do a lot of working with my hands, climbing and stuff as well. And I want something durable.
My husband is not a picky man, and just wants a ring that fits. He works in IT, so no restrictions on his end in regards to materials. I don't necessarily need replicas of the set we had. We are open to different designs.

But what is the best thing to get? I find it almost impossible... because some say to never get titanium or tungsten, whil others say those would be best. I can't seem to find any rings in the physical stores that are made from something other than gold, silver or platinum ( some also have palladium options). 
And in terms of budget, we would actually prefer to not spend too much. As we spent about 1000 euro on our original set. We would like it to ideally be about half of that, or less 😅 

What would you do? Any suggestions?

1fhyga7,Diamonds,mined diamond,1726470153.0,2024-09-16,2024,9,An Unpopular Opinion of James Allen (Natural Diamond Engagement Ring—1.78ct G VS1 platinum 6-prong setting) ,"Hello Everyone. 

I tried posting this review to JamesAllen.com but for some reason the website doesn't let me ""post""..Wondering if it's because the review is not positive? 🤔 

I know how difficult and time consuming it is to shop for engagement rings, so I wanted you all to see my review, because had I seen more reviews like mine, I maybe would have done things differently. Also, James Allen won't let you add photos with reviews, and I think photos speak volumes. Here's the review I attempted to write on JA (excuse the less than perfect hand photo with a little fuzz for flair):


My wife and I both have (natural) diamond engagement rings from James Allen. My wife's wedding ring is also from James Allen. Needless to say, we have invested a lot of money into this company.

We chose James Allen after doing a lot of research. Initially we were very impressed with the customer service. Our rings are/were absolutely gorgeous.

However, after just a few months of wearing my platnium 6-prong engagement ring, things changed. One morning, while we were down at the pool on our honeymoon, I looked down at my hand and my stomach sank as I realized the diamond was completely missing (website won't let us attach photos). Luckily, my wife somehow found the diamond on the floor in our hotel room.

We reached out to James Allen. We expressed our concerns. James Allen replied with generic emails about how they can provide insured shipping labels for us to mail my ring &amp; diamond back for ""inspection."" James Allen is unable to guarantee that repair will be covered under their warranty, which is completely unacceptable since my ring is just a few months old and was only lightly worn. I chose a 6 prong platinum setting because it is supposed to be more secure. Apparently this is not the case with James Allen.

We expressed our concerns about the craftsmanship of our other 2 James Allen rings. It's a lot of emotional stress to think that thousands of dollars can just so easily fall off of our fingers. We asked how JA could insure that, if we mail my ring in for repair, that they will have a different and/or qualified jeweler inspect our ring. I read a review written by another person about how they were told by a different jeweler that there seemed to be an ""issue with the quality"" of the platinum of their own James Allen ring--We asked James Allen about this, and asked how they would insure that if there was an issue with the setting that we would be given a new setting instead of our diamond being placed again into a faulty setting.

James Allen did not answer any of our questions, nor did they seem to care about the emotional stress of the situation. We asked if James Allen would pay for the cost of repair at a local jeweler who we trust, as now we have no faith in the quality in any of our rings from James Allen--again they did not engage us in a dialogue and generically told us we could mail in our diamond and expect there to be a 5-8 week turn around time on inspections/repairs. They want us to pay for our own shipping label, and they cannot even guarantee that repairing our new ring will be covered under warranty. Why would we want to take the risk of mailing our ring, pay for shipping, and then wait weeks for them to possibly tell us that we have to pay for repair?

This is the epitome of poor customer service where customer service really counts. James Allen doesn't care that we are repeat customers, and they are unwilling to reasonably work with us. They care about selling pretty looking rings that apparently don't hold up to the test of time--not that you can even call a few months time at all!

I think now that many of theses positive reviews are written too soon--when rings are still new and when people haven't yet had any issues with their rings.

I hate to write this review at all. We were hoping that James Allen would work with us so that we could explain what had happened and then write an overall positive review about our experience. Unfortunately that was wishful thinking.

Please consider purchasing your rings from a local jeweler instead of James Allen. These big companies don't care about the little guy when it comes down to it, sadly. Ugh. ",107,43,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fhyga7

I bought my 2.12 ct H VS2 old mine cut lab diamond from Loose Grown Diamond. Their antique cut stones are always expensive, but I was shocked to find this one for around $600 and snatched it up!

I labored over how to set it and opted for this antique style solitaire. The setting was custom made by Provence to the exact specs of the stone in 10k yellow gold. I received the semi mount yesterday and had it set today locally for $150.

I’m thrilled. I’ve struggled to find an affordable OMC I love, as it’s hard to find an affordable one at all, and even still, they often have bar cutlets and don’t resemble the true antique OMCs I adore. This one looks exactly like an antique OMC I have!

I do wish it was larger. I’m already feeling the shrinkage! But a custom cut stone would have been $1000+ even for the same size.

I had actually been back and forth with someone at brilliance.com but they took too long to respond to my questions and then their sale ended which annoyed me so I was open to other companies. 

I don’t know much about lab diamonds. I was proposed to with a mined family stone but wanted something a little flashier as a 5 year upgrade. My fingers are crooked, and thanks to hormones, they bounce between sizes so it’s a little loose today (this is a size 6).

It is hard to have an honest discussion on the topic, since things tend to get so heated &amp; debates are not allowed. 
The main argument I hear in favour of natural diamonds is their resale value. 
However, you can never resell jewellery for what it cost you. 
The money you lose when trying to resell your natural diamond could be more that what it would cost to buy a lab-grown diamond.

Thanks to reviewing many posts here I decided to take the plunge and ordered a 3.19 carat F colour VVS2 from Ritani, who price matched Loose Grown Diamond from around $1500 to about $900. Ritani had great customer service and shipping was really fast, I recommend!

Anyway, my mom and my husband both thought I was getting scammed, until the diamond arrived and then they thought oh it's probably CZ.

 So I took it to the jeweller my husband bought my engagement ring from to see if they had one of those diamond testing gun things and if they could make a custom setting.

 They did not have the tester, but could do custom setting, however, when I showed the diamond to the woman there she immediately said: ""this isn't real"". So I asked if she could tell just by looking and she said: ""I can't say for certain, but my eyes have a feeling this isn't a real diamond"". So I said: ""I'm pretty sure it's real, it came with a certificate"" so she says: ""oh is it lab created?"" And I said: ""yes"". 

She said: ""then it's not real"". I nicely told her that lab diamonds are real diamonds and will show as such on the diamond checker gun thing"" (sorry not sure what it's called). 

Her reply: ""oooh I don't think so. Not at all.""  Her voice was so sarcastic and she looked at me like she felt sorry for me.

So I said thank you and left. Went to another jeweller, just as high-end if not more IMHO, with the loveliest associate who on first look said: ""this is a beautiful diamond, I can't tell if it's lab or mined, but it's beautiful"". She used her diamond checker, it read diamond. They also work with you to customize rings to fit diamonds you already own, so I'll likely be going with them to create a ring for it! 

My husband thinks I should write to the 1st jewelery store's owner to let them know  thay They lost a sale of a custom ring because they have an idiot working for them. I doubt they'd care, but I needed somewhere to share this, so thanks for reading if you made it this far!

Went with a Whiteflash ACA ~1 carat VVS2 G natural diamond. On a size 4 platinum solitaire ring.

I’m pretty happy with it. 

However, after speaking with my brother and sister-in-law, I’m now curious about Lab Grown Diamonds. 

I have couple reasons why I went with a natural diamond, but I’m curious on what everyone else’s decision came down to. Whether they decided natural or lab!

I’d assume most people’s biggest reason for deciding lab grown is cost. And it’s very attractive. Considering I could have saved 90% if I went with a similar diamond that was lab grown.

My reason for a natural mined diamond were symbolic. I think there’s some parallels between natural diamonds and marriage.

I will admit, after hearing the only way to discern a natural diamond from a lab grown is the nitrogen content, it is tempting to exchange this for a lab grown. ",121,180,0.85,https://v.redd.it/dcw5rmk560sd1

1fva07m,Diamonds,mined diamond,1727968124.0,2024-10-03,2024,10,$30K Natural Diamond Choices for Engagement Ring,"Hello! I am looking for advice on a few diamonds I am looking for an engagement ring. Budget is $30-40K, looking to stay around \~2.5 carats (natural/mined). I've visited some jewelry store in my area and I know seeing the diamonds in person is best, but I realize I really don't have much of a discerning eye lol and therefore would like to get the best bang for my buck, if possible.

Therefore, I have narrowed down my choices to the following and am looking for some guidance (all are within budget, most expensive is ACA #4 at $40K, which is about $10K above Options #1 and #2, $5K above #3). Hopefully the pics are posted in the right order, but the ones I've narrowed down to are:

* 1: \[James Allen\] 2.77 G-VVS1 (IGI Cert) - JA associate state this has better scintillation than #2, and is a better option;
* 2: \[James Allen\] 2.64 F-IF (IGI Cert) - I know IGI is ""softer"" grading than GIA, but seems like a good value;
* 3: \[Whiteflash\] 2.5 G-VVS1 (GIA Cert) - I like clarity seems great except cloud on one side;
* 4: \[Whiteflash\] 2.54 G-VS2 (GIA Cert) - I read a lot about ""A Cut Above"", curious if the premium is worth it despite much lower clarity (and feathers, clouds, etc.);

This is such a big/important purchase, it's all I've been living/breathing these past few weeks. I understand IGI is not recommended/softer than GIA for natural diamonds, but am curious if the rating (especially color/clarity at near top levels F-IF) would be significantly different than GIA. Any advice (or other recommendations) are also greatly appreciated!

I was worried of getting scammed ordering through a seller with small reviews but figured the igi certiccation would be enough proof. My only worry now was whether I should get the 1.5tcw or 2 tcw studs for my gf. Like the other user, I was really happy when I unpackaged the studs and saw them for the first time.

Only thing left was to verify the report and that's where the issues start. IGI certification no nor qr pull a report on IGI's website. I took the studs out of the box and noticed one was noticeably yellow while the other looked perfect. These are I-J color and i did expect some yellow to show, but still I found it odd one looked flawless.

I did the fog test and noticed they both behaved differently. So I decided to purchase a diamond tester +moissanite tester just in case. Both testers came in about an hour ago and i put in a fresh battery into each.
Went through all the instructions and tested as noted, both tested as diamonds! Great right? 

Nope! Apparently certain testers, mine included, can pass moissanite off as diamonds.Thats's why I also got a moissanite tester. The 2nd tester confirmed that I received 1 moissanite stud and 1 diamond stud.

I'm really disapointed tbh. I reached out to the seller about the igi cert not showing up only, never mentioned the test results nor my doubts about the diamond. Their immediate response was to assure me I did not recreceive a cz or moissanite and that they'll follow up with IGI. I'll update if IGI somehow fixes the issue but I doubt it.

Also, seller supplies jewelery reports not diamond reports. They differ in that jewelery reports rate the piece as a whole but leave out crucial info about the diamond. Also diamond Igi certs require the diamonds to be inscribed with their report number while jewelery reports do not.

Tldr: Cabon-atelier / brilliant carbon gave me studs with a non working (possibly fradulent) IGI jewelery report. One stud tests &amp; looks like the reported diamond other tests like a moissainte.

Edit: So I did watch the documentary everyone talks about, Nothing is Forever, and while I have a few takeaways from it, one is: 

De Beers has an unfathomable amount of diamonds in storage and they can control the diamond market at any moment. 
There are an unfathomable amount of created diamonds flooding the market, and many of these diamonds are grown in China and then exported to India and then go into the market. 
Both sides, mined and lab diamond sellers, don’t know what to do about one another.

We went into Kay’s yesterday just to browse and see what they had.  When we inquired about larger diamonds the sales associate said they didn’t carry high quality diamonds like mine. I said I just wanted to look at what the sizes looked like in real life (looking online doesn’t really help me) and so I tried on a few lab grown diamonds.  I don’t know anything about diamonds but the price difference was pretty wild, a 3 carat lab grown was the same price as my 5/8 carat engagement ring (we upgraded in 2020 when Kay’s was selling out their Tolkowsky inventory).  The sales associate encouraged us to come back to their diamond show later this year to look at higher quality diamonds if I want to have the same quality that I currently have.  
In my head I’ve always wanted to save my wedding rings for my daughters to have after I’m gone, either as something to sell to have a down payment for something or as an heirloom to pass to their kids or grandkids if they want.  
So my questions are: 
Would upgrading to a lab grown diamond from my current on be a mistake? 
Do lab grown diamonds increase in value the way natural diamonds do?
Is Tolkowsky high quality in the diamond world? When I tried to search for a Tolkowsky retailer it seems like they aren’t selling them any more and they don’t even have a website anymore.  
What is an equivalent diamond to the kind of diamond I have now?

I'm shocked at how well 16+mm stone fits my finger. I have long, thin fingers, so I have the room for the stone. I'm waiting on my new wedding band to come from another jeweler. I bought a similar style plated CZ band to wear with this in the meantime! I'll share it tomorrow when it arrives.

Thankful for all the ladies who share their experiences here and exact specs. It makes this process so easy! And yay for diamonds being so darn affordable now! ",401,61,0.99,https://v.redd.it/pz60pomvsxwd1

I’ve requested additional videos in different lighting as well as a close up photo. 

Would appreciate everyone’s initial thoughts. Mine are: 

1) The bow tie on the far right diamond is too prominent. The other two seem within the realm of bow tie reason given they are ovals. 

2) the emeralds are hard for me to gauge here. I think they’re either stunning with fabulous hall of mirror effects or they are far too dark and dead. Some of the most gorgeous emerald cuts i’ve seen over the years have the same dark flashes which is what throws me off.  Fwiw, I like emerald cuts with a lot of contrast instead of super bright ones (if that makes sense)

This post is pretty long, but hopefully informative and can help you make a decision about purchasing from Luvansh.

I was in the market for an upgrade and I knew I wanted a lab diamond. I saw a lot of posts about Luvansh that were positive and decided to go for it because they were running a 20% off sale and the prices were irresistible. I chose a round diamond with good specs but I saw some posts about their classic Solitaire Setting with the four prongs not being great quality. People posted pictures and complained that the prongs were too thin, the stone was set too high, and the setting was not very substantial. I inquired about a custom six prong Tulip cathedral setting and they quoted me $800. The custom setting was not eligible for the 20% off. Being impatient, I decided that I would go ahead and get their hidden halo setting. There aren't really any good pictures of this setting on their website and very few pictures available here on Reddit. However, I was hopeful that the setting would be nice because it had the gallery rail to help hold the prongs together and the center stone did not seem to be set as high as the classic 4 prong setting. I also purchased the 1 ctw seven stone anniversary ring to go with my hidden Halo solitare. The price ended up being very decent after the 20% off. Shipping on the seven stone ring was also very fast and I received it less than a week after I placed the order. I received the hidden Halo solitaire less than two weeks after I placed the order. I received both items sooner than my original expected ship date as quoted on my order confirmation.

Pros: really fast shipping, very responsive customer service by email for inquiries about custom jobs, excellent prices on loose stones. I was able to view a picture and video of my stone directly on their website

Cons: The quality of the metal work is not great, and as others noted, the amount of gold used in the settings is not very substantial

1 ctw 7 stone anniversary ring review: when I first received this ring, I was most impressed by the individual stones, which were all of great quality and clarity and have a lot of fire. What was disappointing was that the ring itself was very light, and the back half of the ring where there are no stones was very thin. The band is less than 2 mm in the back. When looking very closely, the prongs are not completely lined up and even. However, this is really only noticeable to the wearer and would not be noticeable to anyone else because you would have to look very closely. I still enjoy wearing this ring and it looks good paired with the solitaire or by itself. I think that the quality is fair for the price although I do wish that the setting was more substantial. I would've been willing to pay more for more gold in the setting. The ring was overall very good value But you do get what you paid for.

Hidden halo setting review: I would not recommend the hidden halo setting and this part was the most disappointing. The center stone was loose when I received the ring. I had seen other posts complaining about the same problem. The other issue is that the prongs and basket are thin and not very substantial. The ring itself is under 2 mm Thick. It is too thin of a band for a 2.76 carat stone. I didn't really want to go through the hassle of shipping the ring back to them to get it fixed so I took it to my local jeweler. The jeweler actually didn't charge me to tighten the prongs, but while they were tightening the prongs and cleaning the ring, one of the hidden halo stones actually popped out in the sonicator and had to be reset. The local jeweler also mentioned that the prongs are very thin. I now wish I had just gone with the $800 custom six prong tulip cathedral setting that I originally wanted or just gotten the setting done by someone else. if I were to purchase from them again, I would only buy a loose stone and take it to someone else to set. The ring is definitely wearable but I am now paranoid that the stones will fall out of the hidden halo again. From a distance, the ring looks nice and I don't think most people would notice how thin the prongs are So you could still consider getting it because it's a good value. However, if the center stone is loose like it was for mine, you will be disappointed.

Overall, I think their customer service is very good, but I am not impressed with the quality of their metal work. Save yourself the heartache and money and have your stone set somewhere else. I was tempted to get earrings and other pieces but now I'm more hesitant.

When I look love story up online, I only find a lot of diamond rings, stamped with the same words plus a trademark symbol, in a different font. 

What style would this ring be called? I thought maybe a cocktail ring? Or a cluster ring? I tried looking up cluster floral ring, and got some slightly similar styles. It also looks a bit like a peacock shape to me… 

Can anyone tell me about how old it might be? Are the cuts of the stones old antique cuts, or newer modern cuts? I can’t tell the difference between a brilliant cut or an old mine cut / rose cut, etc…

Any idea of value would be interesting g to know, also - I think I paid around $300 - 400 for it.

I love all their designs. And the shop owner, once I texted, is also willing to make custom designs. The prices are reasonable (although sometimes, the price / carat size in different designs have a seemingly slightly inconsistent price to me). But most prices make sense. The seller is very sweet and tried tor reassure me on their quality.

How do I know that this Etsy shop is legit? I really want a lab grown custom design, and I would love to support a small business if I can too.

I know that there's been a lot of Etsy scams lately, especially with stores that buy from cheap mass producers / fakes in other countries, then mark it up and ""resell"" on an Etsy shop. But my reasoning is that if the shop has unique designs and is willing to make custom orders, then it shouldn't be one of those scammy resellers... right? DiamondsbyUK also offer IGI certification for 1+ ct diamonds, and different materials... so it's probably not a scam if it can be customixed right? But, well, I'm definitely not sure about where they source the lab grown diamonds from.

BUT they don't have a shop website outside of Etsy (most other bigger shops do). So I'm not sure if this is a legit but small business, or if I'd be naive buying from them.

Even if I go into a shop with actual store front in person, I wouldn't really know where they source their diamonds from and they could equally lie to me about it. So, I think it's best to skip the fees of having to run a physical store too I suppose.

Anyone got advice in general or experience with this shop let me know!! I'm new to this and I love Etsy, but I want to make an educated purchase!

I also realize that some shops tend to write ""diamond"" but instead use moissanite. How do I ensure this is actually the case? I texted the shop and they said it's lab diamonds, not moissanite.



P.S.

Also, thoughts on these two shops for lab diamonds / gems? Are these trustworthy / the same as natural gems (just not mined)?

Started as the princess center &amp; over the years added the sides &amp; bottom band. I am looking to upgrade to a larger cushion cut stone (I would love an elongated one), but want to keep the same style. I'm assuming most of this would have to be custom. 

1. Should I go to one jeweler for everything custom, or try to find a center stone &amp; a 3-stone ring, then have a custom band made? I'm not sure how well a band would fit under if it's elongated. Should I just get a regular square shape? Any other ideas for a band? I love that they are soldered together.

2. Which jeweler? Buy loose center stone at Luvansh and then setting from Fiorense? Or try to find all stones at Luvansh? How does Fiorense work? Do I send the stone to them, or they send the setting to me? Or do I have to find someone local?

3. Size of center stone? The princess is .61 &amp; the side trillions are .3 each. I was thinking of 2-2.5 carats for the center. Should I keep the same ratios?

I bought it 2 years and it was beautiful white and clean to the eyes and the inclusion was barely noticeable even under 20x loop. Mind you I love diamonds and jewelry and is very picky. I owned all the jewelry accessary such as loop, professional diamond millimeter measurement and etc. So when I buy any piece of diamonds I truly inspect its quality. 

Back to the story, one of the baby setting diamonds cracked and fell off. I asked the rep and she said it would took 2-3 weeks but it ended up to be 4weeks exact. Finally they call me to pick it up the day before Thanksgiving- got there right before they close because I work in retails and got out late. The rep ask me to inspect the prong where the repair was and i looked at the baby diamond and the prong was fine and left. When I went home I notice the big center piece look different.  Under good lighting and the use of my loop it came to my attention that they swap my center stone. This stone has big black inclusions and the girdle is so thick (mine was thin). For sure this was not my original diamonds because my old one had a very little chip under the girdle and this one does not have it. The symmetrical cut was not good because the diamond did not sparkle well. It also has the black bow on the diamond which mine did not have. If I moved my finger/ diamond at certain angle, you can see the black dark shades on the cut on the right side which annoyed the hell out of me. I took a picture at the angle where that spots shows. 

Now I hate this ring and don’t know what to do. I got no proof and it was pass down by Macys employee and shipped to macy partner myjewerlyrepair.com so I can’t even go back there to complain. What can I do now? I can warn other buyers not to trust anyone with your diamonds, especially if it has no laser inscribed in it.

1h4uipf,Diamonds,mined diamond,1733144728.0,2024-12-02,2024,12,Milky Diamonds – What Causes Transparency Issues and How to Identify Them,"We tend to think of diamond as a totally transparent material but that is not always the case. Sometimes diamonds are hazy and often described as looking “[milky](https://www.whiteflash.com/diamond-education/milky-diamonds-transparency-issues/)”.  Diamonds can appear milky for a number of reasons.  Most often the cause is related to the presence of clarity characteristics such as microscopic inclusions, but can also be the result of defects at the atomic level in the carbon lattice.  Strong fluorescence, particularly in combination with light scattering inclusions, can also cause a loss of transparency resulting in the diamond having a hazy or milky appearance.   

It should be noted that transparency is not currently graded or measured on a laboratory report, arguably a failing of the laboratory community given how common transparency issues are and how much they can affect the appearance and performance of faceted diamonds.  But there are sometimes clues to a transparency issue if you understand the nuanced way reports communicate certain information.  In laboratory grown diamonds, atomic level transparency issues are more common, as we will discuss below in a separate section.  Otherwise, this article is generally aimed at natural, mined diamonds. 

Transparency deficits can be very subtle and require a trained eye to assess accurately. Sometimes online images will reveal them, though they may not be obvious - particularly images taken in diffuse lighting.  Directional lighting (such as spot lighting) can show the effect more prominently.  But being able to compare to a diamond with full transparency is often required.  

[Milkiness in diamond on right is subtle in diffuse lighting](https://preview.redd.it/7s4zifrnof4e1.jpg?width=650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=694e1bcfe7f36b75baa60ec502324bead35331c6)

[Milkiness is more pronounced in directional lighting ](https://preview.redd.it/gk86ar1qof4e1.jpg?width=650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=276dd1cce1f742af8f447da62fde90f0ef589149)

# Clarity Features as Cause of Milkiness 

Inclusions can cause light to be scattered and prevent light rays from fully propagating through a diamond.  This can result in a hazy, cloudy or milky appearance depending on severity.  Light scattering inclusions such as twinning wisps, graining, and clouds can interfere with light rays as they are internally reflected within the diamond.  As they exit the crown on their way to our eye those rays are degraded to a point where they no longer have the sparkle or fire we expect from a fully transparent diamond.  Depending on the extent of the interference, the diamond may have only very slightly diminished transparency that is not obvious to the untrained observer.  But if the inclusions are extensive and dense enough or the distortions in the carbon lattice severe enough, the degradation can be obvious – a dull diamond that has no life.  It’s a diamond that looks perpetually like it needs professional cleaning. 

In natural diamonds the chance of this being the case in the high clarity grades is extremely low.  The problem usually exists in the Si and below range.  It is also possible in the VS range, particularly VS2 that might be on the border of Si1. 

# Fluorescence can Cause a Diamond to be Milky 

About 30% of natural diamonds have a property known as photoluminescence – most commonly called fluorescence.  The strength of the effect varies from none or very faint to strong and very strong.  It is known that some strongly fluorescent diamonds appear milky.  A 2021 GIA study on the subject found that most of the fluorescent diamonds that show diminished transparency also contain light scattering inclusions and that fluorescence alone does not cause milkiness.  Therefore, if you are considering a fluorescent diamond it is wise to avoid those stones with graining, twinning wisps and cloud inclusions. 

The same GIA study also revealed for the first time that strong fluorescence can cause diminished contrast, a component necessary for optimal scintillation.  It is possible that this factor may contribute to the perception of the diamond appearing a little flat. This, in combination with light scattering inclusions in the presence of strong fluorescence may be a more complete explanation of why strongly fluorescent diamonds sometimes appear milky. 

# Atomic-level Defects can cause Milkiness 

Diamond is composed of pure carbon atoms bonded to one another in a regular lattice structure. Diamonds are formed as carbon atoms are laid down layer by layer upon this lattice. 

But during formation diamonds can undergo forces that alter the regular pattern of their carbon lattice.  In addition to trace elements being introduced such as nitrogen, hydrogen, boron and nickel, other defects can occur such as atomic vacancies in the lattice. Strain can also occur causing the lattice to be deformed.  Defects in the lattice can have many different effects including causing the diamond to have body color, fluorescence, and also to have diminished transparency. 

# Laboratory Grown Diamonds - Strain and Striation can cause Milkiness 

As noted above, atomic level defects can have impacts on transparency.  This is relatively common in laboratory grown diamonds, particularly those grown by the CVD method.  Whereas HPHT grown diamonds are rigidly constrained during growth by enormous pressure from all sides, CVD grown diamonds are not.  This can lead to deformation of the carbon lattice in the form of crystal strain.  Strain in diamond can best be seen when viewed through polarizing filters, but if severe enough can also affect its visual appearance causing a faceted diamond to have a roiled look.  This can cause the virtual facets to look blurry and for the stone to take on a slight haziness.   A diamond with this problem will never achieve optimal light performance, no matter how precisely cut.  Unfortunately, there is nothing on a laboratory report to draw attention to a problem of this nature. 

The CVD growth method allows an operator the opportunity to stop and re-start the process, sometimes to correct problems that can be observed through a view window on the CVD machine.  Starting and stopping can present its own set of problems however, in the form of striations in the carbon lattice.  This is a type of graining due to fluctuations in the growth environment and if severe enough can make the diamond look milky.  HPHT growth is done in a single uninterrupted run and normally produces diamonds with no appreciable striation, little strain, and generally no transparency issues. 

# BGM – Brown, Green, Milky 

Milky diamonds have a stigma in the market which derives from the diminished fire and brilliance they possess, even when precision cut.  Two other characteristics are likewise stigmatized in the market for different reasons.  Diamonds in the “normal” color range (D-Z) are graded on the basis of the degree to which they have body color in the brown and yellow hues.  Brown in particular is considered by many to be less desirable than yellow.  And rough diamonds with a greenish skin from natural irradiation stains sometimes show a green hue when faceted. These diamonds are highly associated with origins in Zimbabwe (Marange diamond field), and with the political infighting and human rights abuses which led to a ban on trading diamonds from the country.  

To underscore the stigma associated with these three particular characteristics, some diamond manufacturers have developed a designation on their trade listings as “No BGM”, meant to assure their clients that the diamond in the listing is free of these issues. 

# Fancy White Diamonds – the Ultimate Milky Diamond 

Milky diamonds are generally not desirable.  That is, unless they are so milky that they cross over into the fancy color diamond realm.  The ultimate milky diamonds are those that appear white (not to be confused with colorless diamonds that are often referred to as white).  The nano-level inclusions and atomic level “dislocation loops” that typically cause this level of milkiness can make the diamond almost opaque.  The best of these rare diamonds are sometimes described as having an opalescent appearance. 

https://preview.redd.it/wcsv9zwtof4e1.jpg?width=650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d42420f564a274bbd953f74a47aa4c248c7e8591

# Conclusion 

Diamonds are not always fully transparent.  There are a number of causes for diminished transparency including light scattering clarity characteristics such as twinning wisps, clouds and graining as well as defects in the carbon lattice such as strain.  Strong fluorescence can also cause diminished transparency, usually in the presence of light scattering inclusions.  Depending on the severity of the issue a diamond with diminished transparency will look hazy or milky, or just lack the crisp scintillation, fire and brilliance we expect from a gem diamond.  

Because no major diamond laboratory yet measures or grades transparency, it is up to the consumer to understand how to detect an appreciable transparency problem.  This can require a trained eye to assess accurately.  Knowing how to interpret some of the nuances of a laboratory report can be helpful as there are sometimes clues to be gleaned from them. 

Transparency issues in natural diamonds are generally caused by clarity characteristics such as graining, twinning wisps and clouds and are more prevalent in the lower clarity grades.  Laboratory grown diamonds on the other hand are more likely to have transparency issues due to atomic level defects such as strain and striation, even in the highest clarity grades.

I have heard lots of people and dealers say it won't sparkle or 'look right', and it needs to be deeper or proportional, but I don't believe that to be true. In fact, I've seen 3 beautifully wide-spread antique rings about 1 year ago (with &lt;40% depth)- unfortunately I was casually looking before I was ready to propose, and they have been sold. Those dealers all said they were one-offs and didn't have more inventory with the same look. I assume these are items that pop up more in estate sales, so I'm wondering if there are jewelers who have an eye/business around these types of gems.

I live in the the NYC area, but would take any recommendations for any jewelers or dealers that specialize in antique, natural, wide-spread stones. I've also come to learn that no new, modern stones will likely be cut this way (even if they are cut as old-mine, they'll be chunkier \~60-75% depth), as it's not economical to cut a new stone this way.

I’ve searched google, AliExpress, jewelry stores in my region, and even went through several websites. However none of these returned me good results, everything is either too expensive, counterfeit, fake, or cheap drop shipping pieces being sold for 50x more than what they’re worth. 

I am trying to find a good store for purchasing men jewelry made with authentic moissanite for my own personal use for a fair price and quality. 
I love diamonds but I find synthetic and lab made moissanite to be a way better alternative given the price and quality.

I’ve purchased some loose moissanite and was able to commission a jeweler to make me an 18k gold pendant using those gems, however I can’t find the moissanite supplier anymore. Don’t know if it went out of business or what.

Now I’m searching for a store that sells the jewelry itself, not the materials.
In my searches I’ve found a few stores like hello ice and a few others, but after doing some research on them I’ve found out that they are scams or drop shippers.

I don’t need solid gold jewelry, it can be plated as long as it is durable and good quality. 

Also given where I live (Brazil) I can only wear my real gold jewelry to private events because of high crime rate. Don’t wanna get mugged out of my real stuff.

I was instantly in love with the bracelet when I got it. It wasn't until I started getting bombarded with their holiday sale ads that I realized the bracelet I received is a different design from the product photo. As you can see, the stones on mine are set horizontally and they don't look as uniform in size as the product photo. 

Also the product photos show it has elongated radiants, but mine does not. I know the photo of my bracelet make the stones look super yellow too - they're not, they look just like any other diamonds in person. I think it's the yellow gold and poor lighting.

I think it’s pretty, but she just isn’t a keeper. I love the crispness of this stone, but it’s just too dark in my opinion. The only light I really liked it in was natural light (photo + video imgur link)That, or i’ve spent too much time looking at giant 360s and don’t know what real diamonds look like anymore 😂 

I will say, from the online pic, I thought this diamond would have an airy/glassy feel - which I really like - OR be too dark. 

Thought i’d share it anyway! Other than the table being a smidge bigger than I’d wanted, this was an ideal stone in terms of all other measurements. 
Sometimes they just aren’t your cup of tea or things don’t play/balance the way you think they will.

So I am planning to propose in the new year and a couple of weeks ago started looking into rings, and quickly found out about Canadian diamonds. They instantly appealed greatly - me and my SO went on the holiday of a lifetime to Canada this summer, we both love it there, I have family ties there, etc. I also really value the traceability and ethical sourcing of the diamonds, so it has to be a Canadian one.

So I ended choosing a ring from Taylor and Hart based in London, UK, which includes a diamond that the website said was of Canadian origin and is a CanadaMark diamond - all great so far.

Taylor and Hart have been exceptional in their customer service they really have, however I just want to make sure everything is ok and all legit with the diamond for my own peace of mind. I emailed them just to double check that the diamond is Canadian and had Canada Mark certification. The initial reply was that it was mined in Canada but just had GIA certification, not Canada Mark. So I asked them to check as the website clearly stated the diamond was a Canada Mark diamond, and they them confirmed that it was indeed. I asked whether the diamond would be inscribed with a CanadaMark inscription and come with a certificate showing the mine of origin and they confirmed it would and that it would be delivered by the end of December, so the ring was ordered.

I received an email yesterday from T&amp;H saying that the diamond has not yet actually gone through the CanadaMark certification process, which is done externally, and would take about 17 days to three weeks, and the ring therefore will not be ready until the end of January. They said the supplier has mistakenly supplied them with the diamond without issuing the CanadaMark certification in error. However they can post the ring to me without the CanadaMark certification for the proposal, and we can then take it or send it back to them so that it can then be certified.

I just want to know does this sound normal? Will the diamond be able to be certified if I receive it and then take it back after the proposal? T&amp;H have confirmed multiple times by email that the diamond is Canadian and will be Canada Mark certified but this has just made me a bit worried and I just want to make sure that when it goes back there won't be some problem getting it CanadaMark certified etc. I have the GIA certification number and have checked it on the GIA website but it's the CanadaMark one that really is important.

I hope this makes sense, I knew nothing of diamonds before this and know relatively very little now, so apologies for my ignorance!

I'm planning to surprise my wife with some sapphire stud earrings for Christmas this year, and I've finally narrowed it down to two choices.

1. A pair of 6mm **lab grown** sapphire stud earrings, in 9k white gold, from a fairly big/commercial \[online\] jeweller. The stones are very light/sparkly ""AAAA"" rated, which imo doesn't mean anything for lab grown as I assume all lab grown stones are near perfect. Cost is about £260.
2. A pair of 4mm **natural** light blue sapphire, set in silver. Rolled/filled gold is an option but only in yellow, and my wife generally only wears white gold/platinum rings and necklaces so the silver would go better.  The other natural stones I looked at in this price range were dark/dull (granted, in 5mm), but these look beautiful almost like the lab grown versions, but I much prefer the fact that they're natural. There is no mention of a certificate that comes with the stone and this is with an independent jeweller from the UK, from a (well reviewed) Etsy store, which I think is also kind of nicer than big-store. These cost £200.  I wish there was a slightly more expensive 5mm version, but that's only available for a darker/duller natural sapphire, this bright variant maxes out at 4mm. I prefer this setting design too, though both are nice.

  
For the girls in here, which would you rather have...a natural 4mm (in silver) or lab grown 6mm (in 9k white gold)? 

I'm conflicted. Lab grown feels 'wrong', part of the awe is that those colours/materials were naturally made over millions of years. Then again its the same chemical/material, and 6mm seems way more practical.

Is 4mm too small? My wife mostly wears her hair down/covering her ears, so I thought the 6mm might actually be more visible. Tbh, she doesn't ever wear earrings, so probably even 4mm will be noticeable to both of us. 

I think I'm leaning towards the 4mm, but then I look at 4mm on my digital callipers and its frickin tiny.",1,7,0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/1heh0ek/please_help_with_christmas_gift_6mm_lab_sapphire/

My near and dear godmother approached me, asking to have for one of my mother’s most valuable pieces of jewelry. It’s a diamond and sapphire pin that was given to the wives of English colonels. My grandmother left it to her eldest daughter. After she passed, my
Mom got it. Since my mother has now passed, is the youngest sister in question supposed to get it? 

She’s not that close, she actually lives across the world but has kept in touch with me through time. She’s here now, taking care of us, cooking every day. I’m 38, my mother is one of six. 

My mother passed on the 27th December. It’s just too fresh. 

Twiddling her thumbs, she came up to me in front of my husband. “I want to ask you before bringing it up to your dad. I am just so nervous about it because I don’t want to seem like a vulture. Your mother has a pin that was given to our mother by the queen. Can I have it? I’d like to keep it in our family.”

My immediate response was to please not yet bring it up to my dad, and to wait and see if we can find a will or testament in my mother’s writing that May mention anything about the pin. 

As a young girl I remember my mother pulling this pin out and showing it to me, telling me all about it. I don’t recall any mention of how it should be passed down. But she always mentioned that when she left this world, everything that was hers would be mine.

I’m really uncomfortable right now and have no idea what to do. I immediately felt like hiding all of my mom’s jewelry and protecting our family.

Anyone have suggestions? Im the only daughter. The aunt in question has a daughter too. I imagine the pin would go to her when she passes. So what’s the difference? 

It just a feels like she came to “collect what’s hers”. I already gave her a few things. Not of super high value, but nice things. My mother’s passing was unexpected so there is just stuff everywhere. 

Edit: many of you are asking if the eldest daughter who initially inherited the pin had a daughter. She did not have any children. ",869,369,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/1hub6ss/recent_mothers_death_and_the_kind_but_rotten/

I was told it’s “vintage” but unfortunately we don’t know anything about it- where the ring came from, what year, or who made it.

His dad did take the ring to the jewelers to get the materials verified. The ring contains natural mined diamonds, 18k solid gold with a stamp, and a hallmark of “EMJ”. When I looked in the subreddit FAQ for this information, the only hallmark I could find for EMJ was relating to Emmons jewelry, which was a costume jewelry manufacturer from 1950-1980.

I don’t believe this is the same EMJ as Emmons since it is fine jewelry and the hallmark stamp is different. I have found other EMJ “estate” jewelry for sale on eBay that I believe is from the same makers as my ring, but the sellers do not have any additional information.

Below are the eBay listings

They're much more common than they used to be, but still hard to find and sift through. There are a lot less of them than old mine cuts in my opinion. 

  
I've learned a lot about this diamond cut specifically, and wanted to share since it is a more niche area.  I've listed information on how to find them and what to look for in picking one to match your preferences. 

I've great time hunting, and take all of this with a grain of salt. If it helps, great. If not, please do not come for me lol.  There are lot of nuances about types of OECs and transition cuts, but I'm not going to discuss that much because my understanding is limited and it doesn't effect your ability to find and judge stones you like or don't like. 

# Finding a Lab OEC:

There are 3 ways to find a Lab OEC. 1) Online Diamond Databases/Virtual Inventory (think friendly diamonds, luvansh, LGD etc.), 2) Vendors, 3) Local Jeweler. 

**1. Online Databases**

Very few online database sites have a separate selection for old european cut diamonds. The ones that do are: 

* **Loose Grown Diamonds** \- They have the best selection in one place. Most are IGI certified. Best prices. 
   * Biggest con is you have to click each one to see it. Keep reading for some hacks on this.
   * Customer service was great imo. They will try to get you videos of diamonds from manufacturers. 
* **47 Jewelry** \- They have a good selection and have ones I was not able to find on LGD. Most of these are GIA certified. 
   * They are listed in photos grid format with actual diamond photos for quick and easy browsing!
* **Steinhardt and Stones** \- They have fewer for selection, but still a healthy bunch. Most are GIA certified. Lean More Expensive. 
* **Mikado Diamonds** \- You have to search ""European"" in the search bar for them to come up. They have no category, but they have several (200+) that show up in photo grid format for easy browsing. 
   * NEVER BUY FROM HERE. PRICES ARE ASTRONOMICAL. THIS SITE IT JUST USEFUL.
   * I used this site to browse diamonds easily via the photo grid then search the cert number in LGD or elsewhere to see actual reasonable price.
* **Adiamor**
   * Finding this was such a happy coincidence. OECs are not apparent on this site because they are categorized as Asschers in Affinity cut (just switch the filters to search for this and they will come up). 
      * They don't have many, but they of overlap with LGD and Mikado somewhat, and their prices can beat out LGD sometimes. Worth the cross check. 
      * Browsing is also by photo grid. 
* **Friendly DIamonds**
   * They are SO hard to find here, but you can. You have to look at the rounds though w/ table filter. 

These are the places I used the most. The key to finding OECs in databases that don't filter for them is to search (usually) in ""Rounds"" and lower the table to about 53%. Modern cut lab OECs can have a table bigger than that, but I like to start at 53 and work my up to 53-54, 54-55 etc. 53% table is also the max table for a diamond to be graded as an OEC by the GIA.

Ritani allows you to filter by culet which can be helpful in tracking these down. I set my range at very small all the way to large to pick the up most possibilities. 

Obviously this is not exhaustive, but these are things I discovered through trial and error. No one really told me, and I wish they had. 

Perks of using a database type site is easy returns. I did not want to be stuck with one I could not send back. That is true for all shapes. There is a price for this convenience as opposed to going through some of the vendors, but it is worth it in my opinion. I will almost always use a database for cuts I HAVE to see in person to be comfortable with - OECs, Emeralds, Asschers are those cuts for me. 

  
**2. Vendors**

**Several vendors stock and custom cut OECs.** 

* **Distinctive Gem** takes the cake in this category. 
   * His OECs are cut to maximize light performance and boy do they. 
   * They are SO kind and responsive. 
   * Site is easy to browse. 
   * They also have a diamond concierge service you can use to help you find an OEC if one of theirs in not in your budget. 
      * You can look at OECs from the virtual inventory too on his site. I believe they are ones he chooses to display, but I am not 100%. If you want to explore that more, I would reach out to them and ask. 
   * He will custom cut one for you. 
   * The high price is the biggest con. I absolutely think these stones are worth what is charged, but that doesn't mean that is always within a budget. 
* **Fiorese/Tianyu/Ouros/Diamond Rensu**
   * Popular vendors on this sub who have been doing OECs for a long time. 
   *  I feel like quality, price, and overall processes are pretty similar, so I've looped them together here. 
   * They stock OECs or can cut them for you. 
   * Personally, I don't like most of the ones that come from these vendors. Something about them is off to me, and they all tend to use the same facet pattern. 
   * If their stones are your thing and you are not concerned about returns, they're an awesome pick. Shoutout to Sonia at Fiorese who has never let me down. 
* **Delicate Gem**
   * They carry OECs in house, and they seem like they're beautiful.
   * Have physical location in NYC
   * I've seen some around this sub and you can search them as well. 
   * When I reached out, I got a response initially but was then left on read. I know others have had very different experiences, I just wanted to throw that out there. 
* **Lauren B**
   * They have a database on their site you can search, but all of their stones are in-house and have a legitimate video, not just a 360. 
      * not a ton of selection on their site
   * Physical location in NY. 
   * Their stones are all GIA from what I have seen. 
* **Alex Park**
   * Popular IG seller
   * I like their OECs a lot, but they don't keep a ton of stock. Usually first come basis from insta postings. If you're down to be patient and stalk his page/are going big enough to get a custom cut from him, I think he is a great choice. 
   * Customer service is pretty non-existent from my communication, but that's the trade for his amazing prices imo. 
   * Some of his stones are certified, some are not. I do not know whether you can request certification. 
* **Ivy and Rose**
   * They sell natural and lab OECs. They don't go much bigger than 2 ct from what I have seen on their site, but they are gorgeous and competitively priced. 
   * Brick and Mortar storefront in Chicago. 
* **Debebians**
   * They carry OECs in house and have some listed from the database. 
      * Not a ton of selection on their site
   * They have cut stones for folks in the past I've read from other Redditors, so that is an option as well. 

  
**3. Local Jeweler**

* Any local Jeweler should be able to source some for you to see in person. It is a lot more time consuming, but I think this is 100% worth it if you're undecided on whether this is the cut for you. My jeweler brought several in but also encouraged me to keep looking on my own in case I was able to source one I loved. This is what a jeweler should do in my opinion. Don't be afraid to ask or refuse to buy. I will absolutely buy from my jeweler at a but higher price if they find me one I love. 



# How to pick an OEC:

We pick OECs with our hearts, not our minds. 

There are no ideal parameters in choosing an OEC like there are for other cuts. There are also many different flavors of OEC. 

Generally, OECs have small tables (less than 53% by GIA standards) and high crowns. They have culets. They can be faceted with pinwheel like shapes, petal like shapes, or more bubbly shapes. They all look very different. Some have kozibe effect, others do not (the lawyer in me is dying for a footnote option here - kozibe effect is the reflection of the culet seen in other parts the diamond. Examples later). Some have more of a transitional era vibe which checkerboard facet patterns. There is so much variety and it is based on preference.

Some General things most want to avoid (not saying you have to, this is just a generalization): 

* **Super dark centers.** This is where the center facets go dark all at the same time. It creates a black hole. This one also has a large culet I don't love. [https://loupe360.com/diamond/LG647448704](https://loupe360.com/diamond/LG647448704) 
   * Real video of this exact diamond here: [https://imgur.com/a/mBse0a0](https://imgur.com/a/mBse0a0)
* **Very large culets** \- they are distracting and will show right down to your setting. 
   * This stone is so bright and lively, but the culet takes away. [https://loupe360.com/diamond/LG627445081](https://loupe360.com/diamond/LG627445081)
      * Real Photo (I had a video, but it is not working properly) [https://imgur.com/HlQ0ziU](https://imgur.com/HlQ0ziU)
   * Idek wtf this one is trying to do,  but its a great example lol [https://loupe360.com/diamond/LG634430160](https://loupe360.com/diamond/LG634430160)
* **Flatness** \- the facets do not turn off or on at all really. Everything looks the same. 
   * I don't have a live video or photo, but here is what I think of as flat. Reminds of me Tin Foil. Just say no tin foil diamonds. 
   * \*\*Disclaimer, I don't have a live diamond to compare these 360s to, so maybe I'm dead wrong. Or maybe it's foil.

**Facet Pattern Examples:** 

\*This is just for facet examples. Not saying I love them all or that they're perfect. I've also picked these names for their general meanings. Others use them too but they aren't technical terms. 

* **Pinwheel**
   * The super dark center examples above has what I call a pinwheel pattern. The spokes from the middle are more pointy and skinny.
   * [https://loupe360.com/diamond/634499682](https://loupe360.com/diamond/634499682)
   * [https://loupe360.com/diamond/%20LG596309076](https://loupe360.com/diamond/%20LG596309076)

1hwdmpj,labdiamond,natural diamond,1736318352.0,2025-01-08,2025,1,Shifting from Natural Diamonds to CVD – Need Advice on Trusted Buyers and Platforms,"

Hey everyone,

We are based in surat, India. And I've been in the natural diamond trade for a while now, but with the way the market is evolving, we’ve decided to start working with CVD (lab-grown) diamonds as well. It’s an exciting shift, but also feels like stepping into unfamiliar territory.

In the natural diamond business, I had my network and trusted channels, but with CVD, I’m still figuring things out—especially when it comes to finding reliable buyers and marketplaces.

If you’ve been in this space or have any experience with CVD diamonds:

Where do you usually sell or trade CVD diamonds?

Are there platforms or buyers you’d recommend (or avoid)?

Any tips or insights for someone making this transition?


I’d really appreciate any guidance you can share. Thanks a lot in advance, and looking forward to hearing from you all!

She really wants an emerald or oval cut diamond. I am looking to go for a 4 carat stone that I will set at my jeweller. 

My question is: should I go lab grown or natural? Obviously there will be an insane price difference and my wife has said I should go for lab grown because no one would be able to tell the difference.

Personally, I feel like lab grown diamonds are money in the trash since they hold no value, but I know diamonds in general don’t really hold value. I’m torn. I love her very much and she deserves the best, so I just want to get her something she will love and be able to pass down to our kids one day.

Additional info: I make a decent living but this would definitely be something I need to save up for (if I go the natural route) as I estimate it would cost around $60k for a good quality 4 ct stone.

It is unlike the others and you can see how it’s coming out. Is there any way I can put this back in myself? What tools would be necessary for this sort of procedure? 
Professional jewelers (Joe Escobar diamonds store) told me the metal holding the turquoise in place is so delicate that setting new / different stones would be basically impossible and that I’d have to fabricate a new ring from scratch, costing hundreds of dollars. -_-

I asked about the possibility of making a riviera in 925 silver and lab diamonds, and they said yes.

I asked if they could make it heavier, like 8 or 9 grams, and they said no mine has 7.

When it was ready, they sent me a video. I asked for photos, but they didn't reply. The next day I sent a message and they asked directly for my address, and ""forgot"" to send detailed photos.

Ok, I trusted them, and when it arrived:

Before you tell me that we get what we pay for, I have 3 silver rivieras from AliExpress and the casting quality is much, much better. (kuololit and attagems)

There is one or two small deviations but when it is on the wrist it is not noticeable.

The clasp is very fragile, the side straps don't stay in place and it's crooked.

I spoke to them and suggested that they improve the clasp, but that's it.

Why don't I return it? because I paid 100usd in import tax and this amount would not be refunded.

What I am going to do is use these diamonds to make other jewelry in the future.

With this experience I learned that I prefer to just buy loose diamonds and have them made by a local jeweler who I can inspect the details.

Do I recommend buying from them? Yes, but for heavier pieces, they always ask for close-up photos. And the diamonds are beautiful.

Would I buy from them again? Yes, just loose stones.

1i7yv3w,labdiamond,natural diamond,1737620793.0,2025-01-23,2025,1,[Advice needed] Choosing diamond for my engagement ring,"Hello!

I'm very new to the field of lab diamonds. It all started when I wanted to propose to my girlfriend and that of course, comes with a ring. I've heard from others the possibility of having a complete identical product like a mined diamond for a fraction of the price of a natural diamond and thought that sounds amazing! Also my girlfriend would love the idea of something made in a lab and not running the risk of a blood diamond. 

So after reading and watching everything about lab diamonds for the past week, I know the two different methods HPHT and CVD used in the process of making a lab diamond and both their advantages and disadvantages. I've also chosen my jeweller and setting for the diamond ring but now I need to choose the middle stone for the trilogy ring. 

I understand the concept of a ""open"" database where people are selling diamonds for a chosen price. But after looking at different diamonds, both spec and images/videos, I still have some questions regarding the prices. 

Just to give some examples:

[https://loupe360.com/diamond/5516179076](https://loupe360.com/diamond/5516179076)  
This is a 7121$ Round 1.20 ct D IF 3xEX, comes with GIA cert (I know this is properly some of the best you can get) but the price is somehow really high? Also how can you see on GIA report if its HPHT or CVD made? It only says Lab grown.

[https://loupe360.com/diamond/LG671432975](https://loupe360.com/diamond/LG671432975)  
This is a 1533$ CVD Round 1.05 ct D IF 3xEX with IGI cert. This is what I would more think is the ""normal"" price given that they say a lab diamond is around 1/5 of the price of a mined one. 

  
[https://loupe360.com/diamond/LG675554276](https://loupe360.com/diamond/LG675554276)

This is a 697$ HPHT Round 1.01 ct D IF 3xEX also with IGI cert. This is half price of the above? 

[https://loupe360.com/diamond/LG674540238](https://loupe360.com/diamond/LG674540238)

This is a 488$ HPHT Round 1.00 ct D VVS2 3xEX. I know the clarity is of a lower grade compared to the other ones but this sounds really cheap?

  
So my question is, diamonds with similar specs have totally different prices so what is the catch? I know there could be some ""defects"" from the manufacturing process like strains in CVD or brown tint. And for HPHT there could be a blue hue. I would like to hear what I should be aware of when picking the right diamond for my ring while not only taking the price into consideration. I want to find a good balance between price and a decent stone.

When he showed me the receipt and I saw it wasn’t a lab grown and saw how much he paid for it, we decided to take the ring back. I then came here and did some research and landed on Loose Grown Diamonds. I poured over every Reddit post I could find and they were all so helpful so I wanted to share my experience for others who are considering lab grown diamonds.

I've recently started helping a new antique jewelry seller with her site as a passion project of mine - she is a powerhouse of a woman who recently retired from a high-powered STEM job to do what she really loves, sharing the antique jewelry she has been sourcing for decades with the world.

Her site is launched, she's had a few successful pop ups, but I would LOVE for her to be surprised by her first organic sale (to be clear, she does not know that I am posting this and I am not sure she has heard of Reddit to begin with, hah!).

He was afraid I paid too much- thankfully when I told him what I paid (thanks  Luvansh and your 30% off sale lol) he was like ""oh okay well that's good."" But am I crazy? I realize lab diamonds are not natural or nearly as rare- but they are the same make up and strength as natural.. at one point in my head I was like ""please.. call them counterfeit one more time.."" I pointed out that if I were to lose my ring I don't want to lose  thousands of dollars.. financially it makes sense to me.

I placed five orders with Luvansh throughout the 30% off sale in December and just received the final one. I ordered four loose diamonds (a ~2 carat heart, two ~1 carat hearts, and a ~5 carat radiant), two pairs of diamond hoop earrings (1.1 carats and 2.4* read about this experience further down), and a 14 carat diamond tennis necklace. My loose diamonds all came pretty quickly, within a week or two. The quality seems great and they’re beautiful. I received my settings today from Tianyu and will be having them set as soon as I find the right jeweler to do it. I’ll include a photo of the settings at the end, they’re for all of the heart diamonds (I haven’t had a setting made yet for the radiant). I received my hoop earrings about a week ago. The day before I got them, I received a shipping notification that said something along the lines of they’ve been shipped, but the 2.4 carat is out of stock and would be replaced with the 3.6 carat. I am fine with this upgrade, however thought it was very strange that 1- they don’t even have a 3.6 available on their website, 2- I wasn’t given the option to cancel the item, it was more so I was expected to just accept that I was getting something different than what I ordered, and 3- Luvansh was spelled incorrectly in the email. The earrings are beautiful though and I really am happy with the upgraded size. After seeing the quality of some other jewelry that people have received from Luvansh, I feel very fortunate that mine are beautiful. Two days ago, I finally received my 14 carat tennis necklace after a month long wait. I am so incredibly thrilled with it. It’s definitely a bit bigger than I had anticipated, but I still think is appropriate for daily wear. I’ve only worn it for two days now but the clasp feels super secure and I’m not noticing that it flips at all (it can’t flip all the way, just seems to slightly move as I had expected it would). I had been eyeing the tennis necklaces at a local jewelry store for over a year now, but they were natural diamonds and sooo much more than what I paid. I’m excited to have discovered to world of lab diamonds, as it makes it all so much more accessible. Overall, my experience with Luvansh has been good. I think they were absolutely inundated with orders because of how long they ran the sale (which is still going on), and are struggling to keep up. I personally think they should stop the sale in order to catch up on the orders that are taking a long time, but I’m glad to have gotten everything I ordered without issue. I’ve included photos of all items.

1. Open to Oval/moval shapes 
2. Want a yellow diamond but conveniently don’t like fancy yellow so looking at very low on white diamond colour scale (I’ve seen stones M and below I love the look of!)
3. Would like it to be as close to excellent on symmetry and polish 
4. Clarity willing to go for anything eye clean
5. No bow ties
6. Open to new or vintage/old mined diamonds

An excerpt that made me snort: 
Geoffrey Farrow at Raphael, a jeweller on the other side of the street, can only just bring himself to sell lab-grown diamonds. “They are synthetic,” he said. “Lab-grown sounds exotic, but it’s created – they make it by the buckets. There’s no history to it. The price is going to go down further and further. “It makes the stone that much cheaper, and people have the illusion that being big is something special. It’s not. It’s quality that you want.”

My thoughts: 
Lol, someone's maddddd. And what is the ""history"" behind a natural diamond? Years of colonization of Africa? Slave and child labour? Gang violence? Exploitation? No thanks. I'd rather have a lab grown sparkler that didn't cause a child to be orphaned or have to work to be able to feed themselves. 
Interesting read. I just hope the downward prices trend continues and these things become more accessible. I hate the snobbiness not just when it comes to jewelry but anything including handbags and perfumes which are my other current obsessions lol.

They look beautiful in natural light and I doubt anyone would notice the slight windowing other than me so I may just keep them. 

1.51 ctw emerald cut lab diamond studs (non certified), D VVS/VS, 935 silver, $362.  My second piercing, where I plan to wear these, is sensitive and sometimes white gold will cause irritation but silver does not...go figure. Stones are very white (they look warmish in the pics due to my office lighting), settings looks exactly as I requested and are stamped 935.

I worked with Melody on these, she was very responsive and easy to deal with.  My one request was no windowing.  The videos and such looked great but I know it can be hard to tell unless you see a stone in person, especially in smaller carats like these.  So I asked Melody if there was any windowing and she assured me there was not and we discussed what causes it, etc.  Unfortunately, there is some windowing through the center of the stones.  Not bad and Melody assured me that I could check them upon receipt and return them if I was not happy.  In stones this size, and at the price I got them for, I do not know if it is really worth the hassle of a return/exchange or if it will even be noticeable once worn.  But it is there, nonetheless. Overall, my experience has been good and I am sure that Melody will work with me if I decide I am not 100% happy.  I will likely use them again in the future.

1iciavv,jewelry,lab grown engagement,1738114231.0,2025-01-29,2025,1,Diamond loose for the third time in three years,"I have a 1.5 ct marquise solitaire. 

The stone was my mother’s. The setting was modeled after one I came across in a shop. Fairly simple, 18kt gold.

The setting was created by a colleague of my stepmother’s. She worked in the diamond/jewelry industry her entire life. The person who made it is fantastic.

About a year into wearing it, I could hear the diamond rattling a bit.

I took it to a local jeweler (a good one in NYC), as I live across the country from my family and the guy who made my setting. 

Of course they charged me $280 and took three weeks to repair it. Such is NYC life.

Anyway, about 8 months later, I hear the rattle again. This time, I wanted to find a different jeweler who wouldn’t gouge me.

A neighbor recommended some guy in the diamond district, who apparently will repair prongs within an hour. 

I took it to him, paid $100, came back an hour later. A while after I got my ring back, I noticed the prongs were suuuper misshapen and screwed up. 

So, the next day I take it to another place by me and the jeweler points out that the booth guy definitely broke the prongs and hastily tried to make new ones. 

I pay this guy $300 to basically rebuild my ring.

It comes back and it’s fine, though he did not build the prongs back as they originally were. They had been a lot more refined. Now I notice they are not as evenly-shaped, they are more pointy vs. rounded, etc. 

I also notice the prongs seem to catch on things more due to not being shaped as smoothly. I have to take my ring off to simply put my hair in a ponytail, which I never had to do before.

The prongs are also sharp now on their surface. If I run my ring along my skin, it scratches me.

I decide that eventually I’ll have my stepmom’s guy redo my prongs when I am back in California. But for now, it was fine.

Fast forward another 8 months later — today — I hear my diamond rattling AGAIN.

I don’t know what the deal is honestly. It has similar prongs to the solitaire marquise I see at any shop. They aren’t super thin or anything extraordinary.

I take my ring off to sleep and shower. I have a computer job and work from home. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t keep spending $250-500 every 8 months to repair this ring. 

I reached the point today where I honestly considered putting this ring away and buying myself a lab-grown diamond ring in a different shape. I saw some for $2k. Honestly, I’ve almost paid that in the last 2 years to fix this ring. 

I love that this stone is my mom’s but wtf. 

Aside from the cost, it’s annoying. I didn’t have the chance to get it repaired for a while last year while exploring options, and literally couldn’t wear my ring for 6 entire months. 

Then, when I need to get the prong fixed from the one place I trust now, they take my ring for weeks because they are snobby and know they’re the only trustworthy jeweler for a mile radius. 

Anyway, just wondering if anyone else deals with this. 

Can’t blame it on the jeweler, as it’s come loose from three separate jewelers’ work now. 

I’ve asked jewelers whether there’s something wrong with the setting, and they say “no there shouldn’t be.”

One recommended I only wear it for special occasions!!! Wtf

Meanwhile, my stepmom (again, jewelry expert) said I should be able to wear it on a day-to-day basis. 

The other thing I could consider is changing the setting to a basket. But I wear a thick gold wedding band, which I would no longer be able to wear if I did that. No thanks.",3,18,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/1iciavv/diamond_loose_for_the_third_time_in_three_years/

1idnj4k,labdiamond,natural diamond,1738245482.0,2025-01-30,2025,1,Genuine Question About Lab-Grown Diamonds,"
Hey everyone,

I’ve been curious about lab-grown diamonds and wanted to share some thoughts that I’m wrestling with to see how others feel about them.

I completely understand that lab-grown diamonds are nearly identical structurally and visually to natural diamonds. From a logical standpoint, I get why they’re a great option—more sustainable, ethically sourced, and often more affordable. But emotionally, I can’t help feeling hesitant about them.

To me, part of the appeal of a diamond is its history and rarity—the fact that it’s something discovered and shaped by nature over millions of years. Lab-grown diamonds, while incredible in their own right, feel… manufactured, and I struggle with the idea that it makes them seem “less real” or valuable.

I don’t mean to offend anyone who loves or has a lab-grown diamond—this is purely my personal hang-up. I’m just trying to understand: do lab-grown diamonds still carry the same sense of value and meaning to you? Have any of you felt the same hesitation and moved past it? I’d love to hear different perspectives!

Thanks in advance!

I have only recently gone to look at diamonds in person at local jewelry stores but that has only added to my confusion – so, I have come here for more guidance. My Sister has a Hearts On Fire princess cut that I find very nice. It has tons of fire and will be bright and sparkle even in a dark room so I believe I would like to purchase a ring that maximizes brightness and fire. My girlfriend insists that I select the diamond – she has only stated that she would like something simple in design (so a solitaire setting), she prefers a classic round brilliant and would like something “bigger” (this was relative to a 1 carat stone that she sent me a picture of and I was telling her that I was looking at something more around 2 carats). She has a ring size of 4.5 and has stated that I am absolutely not to ask her anymore questions regarding ring selection nor will she go in person to view carat sizes herself.

When I went to see the diamonds in person a 2 carat wasn’t as large as I thought it was and I ended up settling more into the 2.8 to 3.5 range because of her stating she preferred something bigger. I viewed many, many diamonds there – they were pretty – but I was expecting one to jump out at me and it just didn’t happen (natural nor labs). From there, I was presented with 3x different round stones:

2.68 carat – F – VVS2 which tested as an AGS 0 – it was priced at $1260 (diameter: 8.95mm, total depth: 5.46mm, table: 5.12mm, crown: 34.3, pavil: 40.8, culet: 0.3% pointed, girdle: 2% sl. thick – sl. thick)

2.71 carat – F – VS2 which tested as an AGS 0 – it was priced at $4665 (diameter: 8.89mm, total depth: 5.51mm, table: 5.09mm, crown: 35.7, pavil: 40.6, culet: 0.3% pointed, girdle: 2.2% sl. thick – sl. thick)

3.08 carat – F – VVS2 which tested as an AGS 1 – it was priced at $1560 (diameter: 9.37mm, total depth: 5.75mm, table: 5.53mm, crown: 33.6, pavil: 41.5, culet: 0.3% pointed, girdle: 2.1% sl. thick – sl. thick)

Neither of the three I found to be a perfect match. The 2.71 carat by far had the most fire – it was very impressive in that regard but it was a very dark stone – it looked clearly brownish which I didn’t like at all. The 3.08 carat didn’t seem to have nearly as much fire but it was very clear and looked like ice – I appreciated the ice aspect of it but really it didn’t flash nearly as much color or fire as the other stones but I did find its size very impressive as well as how clear the stone appeared, though, without fire it was kind of boring. The 2.68 carat kind of fell in the middle – it’s size wasn’t as impressive, it flashed a decent amount of fire and wasn’t quite as ‘ice-like’ as the 3.08 carat. I should also add that I viewed each stone under an ASET device but I didn’t find that as helpful as looking at ASET images online where it is computer generated and I can immediately compare it to a reference image.

Since that visit, I went to another store and was presented with some nice stones but I soon began to feel overwhelmed in the process.

I have now returned to looking at stones online and am considering purchasing a stone online and having it put in a setting locally. I am selecting mostly from [loosegrowndiamonds.com](http://loosegrowndiamonds.com) and inputting what I am to understand are ideal parameters – L/W ratio of 1.00-1.01, a depth of 61.5-61.7, a table of 55-56 and selecting Hearts and Arrows. However, most of the reports do not include any ASET images so it is difficult for me to judge the light performance of the stone. I will send a link below to a few stones I have been looking at – I would like to maximize brightness and fire and avoid too much coloration of the stone (like the obviously brown one I listed above). I selected for stones of a color D or E since the one stone that was very obviously brown was F in color (though, I’m not even sure if the color rating was the reason of the stones color). I would like to stay at $4,000 or less for the stone itself - if I can save additional money and I won't be able to tell a difference in stone performance then that is also a plus. Any suggestions would be very much appreciated as I’m not quite sure where to proceed from here..

I don’t really have anyone to share this with, but I just have to let out my excitement—so here I am!

As the subreddit suggests, I’ll be proposing soon!

My girlfriend of 5 years isn’t a materialistic person—she’s the type who insists she doesn’t want anything for her birthday and always puts others’ comfort before her own. It’s a quality I deeply admire and love about her. Of course, despite her insisting she doesn’t need or want gifts, I make it my personal mission to surprise her anyway—because let’s be honest, I know better.

That said, we recently had a casual conversation about engagement rings, and I think I managed to play it cool—she has no idea what’s coming! After carefully looking at her other jewelry, taking note of the preferences she’s shared, and even observing the styles of people around her, I finally made my decision.

Now, as an engineering student working full-time alongside my studies, I’ve been able to save up what I consider a meaningful amount for her ring. And let me tell you—I took a deep dive down the rabbit hole when it came to finding the perfect diamond. I now know more about the 4Cs, fluorescence, and certifications than I ever thought I would.

And after all the research and planning, I (and soon she!) am the proud owner of this beautiful, minimalistic  platinum solitaire ring.

I can’t wait for the moment I get to ask her to spend forever with me!

1ifkl71,jewelry,natural diamond,1738455658.0,2025-02-02,2025,2,Did I get ripped off?,"So I bought an 8mm 22"" solid .925 sterling silver cuban link chain with ""luxx diamond alternatives"" from luxx jewelers for $700. Here's the description:

Description
Our Diamond Cuban Chain is perfect for special occasions or just for everyday wear. The single row of big stones make this chain sparkle and shine. The size is just right for a comfortable feel and timeless look.

Width: 8mm
Material: Solid 925 Sterling Silver
Finish: High polish with Rhodium
Stones: Luxx Diamond Alternatives™ (VS+, D-F color)
Weight: 70-101 grams / 8-12.5 ctw (18-26 inch)
Clasp: Custom foldover
Quality: Made by hand

Here's what they say luxx diamond alternatives are in their q&amp;a section:

Luxx Diamond Alternatives™ are lab created diamond simulants, that closely resemble the look and feel of a natural diamond. Indistinguishable to the human eye, eco-friendly, ethical, and affordable. Developed with our proprietary technology and standards to make luxury accessible, without sacrificing quality. All Luxx Diamonds™ are VS+ clarity, D-F color, and brilliant cut which results in exceptional shine.

Before making the purchase, I did some research, and the little information I could find said luxx diamond alternatives were just moisonnite. I looked around and saw a similar chain(same length, same mm, solid sterling silver, cuban link), but without the stones. Prices ranges from $200-500. I also saw a chain with the same specs as the one I bought, but with moisonnite stones, for $850, so I went ahead and full sent the purchase.

When i got the necklace i took it to kay jewelers, and it did not test positive for moissanite, or anything at all. She said it was most likely some other gemstone mixture.

It's a good looking chain, but having no idea what type of stones are really in my necklace, how badly did I get ripped off, and is it bad enough to return it? (I'll have to pay shipping, and keep in mind i didn't have to pay taxes for the purchase, so the price of the chain was more around 610-630).

I love it alot sentimental wise, but I also want to make some changes so it still feels like it's mine. Other than sizing up the ring I would like to swap the 4 rubies in the center for lab diamonds or another clear stone.

I was also wondering however if there is a way to possiblity ""fill"" the gaps on the sides of the center part. Either with a small design or possibly another gemstone. I don't know. I just personally don't love the look of the gap, but I don't know what's possible or what it would cost. I don't mind adding new things to the ring, but don't want to lose so much of it that it doesn't feel like a inherited gift, if that makes any sense...

The ring supposedly is platinum and white gold, I don't know the details exact since my aunt passed a few years back. All my grandmother knows is it has platinum somewhere and that the gems were rubies. She had the ring evaluated at a shop a few years ago after my aunt had passed. They offered $2000 for it.

We don't know the age of the ring either or it's background. My great uncle received the ring from his father who ran estate sales back in the 60's. We assume he got it from one of them.",1,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1igzcxk

Both stones were sourced by Luvansh at the end of October/early November time frame. I didn’t have any issues ordering or receiving these stones. Both rings are 14K, size 7.

1. Princess cut, 4.71c, F, VVS2. David Klass created the setting including the round citrines, yellow sapphire pear, and round brilliant brown diamonds. The experience was 10/10. Honestly, I don’t love the princess cut on me- I think I’ve determined I prefer a rounded corner more. I looked for inspiration and found a setting I liked from Bario Neal and reached out to David Klass to create it for my stone. Surprise- I love it! It’s not my usual aesthetic but I think this is so sweet and lovely and as I told DK I think I am a princess evangelist now! DK was quick to source stones, found replacements when I had minor feedback, created the setting all before I shipped my stone! I wanted to wait until after the holidays due to the chaos of the last two weeks of December. DK helped to coordinate shipping. Once he received the stone it was set within a week and he did next day shipping. I highly recommend his services! Not every project of mine requires such care and skill but for those where I want that I think he’s my go to! I know he sets stones so may consider that in the future if I get semi mounts internationally.

2. Radiant, 5.41c, F, VS1. Taddei coordinated the setting and set the stone. This experience was maybe a 6/7 out of 10. This was a setting I felt less strongly about and so was willing for a different experience. The main issues I had is that the final setting didn’t match the approved CAD- it was missing a hidden halo, and the communication/timelines weren’t as smooth. I was quoted 4-6 weeks and the project took 8-9 weeks. The cost was reasonable and I honestly am not upset about the missing halo but this is something that would bother me in a different scenario. I also didn’t need this quickly or need the timelines to be met but wanted to flag it in case others read my feedback. For me these were not issues but I prefer slightly more  communication and attention to detail. ",111,19,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iinenf

I'm making this post because I commented on a post earlier that I had purchased 24 loose diamonds from Luvansh and CocoHaight asked me to share what pieces I've had made with so many stones...

All of the diamonds were purchased as loose stones and I had my jeweler set them all...

I only have pics of 19 of my diamonds as I have gifted several pieces to my oldest daughter...

Keep in mind I'm not a jewelry designer by any means so my pieces are kinda boring, meaning the designs are not very unique, but I love and cherish them all...

My ring and earring pics are taken in several different lighting situations...

Pic 1 - My diamond charm bracelet... I started this project when Mom was first diagnosed with terminal cancer... Mom LOVED jewelry and I knew she would love this idea I had of making a diamond charm bracelet... She loved my James Avery charm bracelets so I knew she would love this project of mine...

Sadly, Mom passed just 15 weeks after her diagnosis and I was not able to complete my bracelet in time, so she never got to see it...

It's a gold James Avery bracelet and I purchased 1 of each of the 10 shapes of diamonds Luvansh has on their website... The largest being the pear shape as it's my favorite shape... The total carat weight is 12.30 carats as Mom's birthday is December 30th...

Pic 2 - My round pendant - D colored 1.61ct internally flawless

Pic 3 - The studs I've had made... The pears are 3.5ctw ... The larger rounds are 3.10ctw and the smaller rounds are 2.20ctw ... 

Pic 4 - This is one of my right hand rings... it represents my Mom... The gold bands are all made from her wedding cigar band that I had melted down... the center stone is 3ct, as she was 30 when she had me... and each eternity band has 12 stones, for a total of 24, the age she was when she got married... I have 2 James Avery silver bands in this stack... I love mixing metals...

Pic 5 - My 30yr wedding ring upgrade... The solitaire on my ring has been upgraded several times over the years and this upgrade is my final one... It's a 5.06 pear, as our wedding anniversary is May 6th... It's set on an 8mm cigar band with 3.5 mm half eternity bands solderd on either side, for a total of 15mm... She is very high set, which I know is not everyone's cup of tea, but I wear her every single day, and have for 30 years, and have never had a problem banging it on anything...

I have sapphires in the bands because they are my birth stone... There are 11 stones in each for a total of 22, which is how old I was when I met my husband... The solitaire makes 23, which is hubs birthday...

These are the majority of my purchases with Luvansh... I also purchased premade 1ctw studs and 2 5 stone rings...

I've been purchasing with them since they were a very new company and have only ever had 2 issues... 1 was resolved immediately and the other took a month to resolve, this was back in November when things started getting back logged for them but they eventually made it right...

All of which are uncomplicated tweaks of existing designs. While I am not in a huge hurry, we began working on these last Oct 23.

I have an existing ER setting I wanted remade in platinum with my birthstone as accents instead of clear diamonds. The second band is a gypsy (or Tiffany) style 3mm platinum band with alternating lab diamond and sapphire encircling the band (which they erroneously thought only went halfway around the band). The final ring is a slightly tweaked, pre-existing Fiorese design of a half anniversary, platinum band of Asscher cut lab diamonds. 

They evidently missed detailed requests that were pretty clear from the beginning. For example, that the Gypsy band was to have the stones encircle the entire band, and not just half of it. That the stone sizes should be proportional to those shown on the sample band photo. That the sapphires, whether natural or lab, should be of the quality and color of the stone samples sent. Finally, that the sapphire accents for the ER should be as large as possible and either trilliant or round in a 3-prong setting (if possible), in order to make them more prominent than the original ER design setting. 

I approved the CAD of the Asscher anniversary ring 7 Jan. On 15 Jan she sent a fuzzy photo of proposed sapphire stones; I requested clearer photos and updated CADS for the ER and the Gypsy style band. She’s ghosted me since.",0,15,0.29,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1imedm7

Anyway, we were thinking of replacing the halo setting all together with a larger lab grown stone. The current stone is a natural one carat diamond plus the halo, which I would have made into a necklace pendant. Thinking of buying a loose stone from Luvansh, that would be better cut, color, etc. around 2 ct. The dimensions of that size of stone should fit within the bands but not be too much smaller.

I had seen the most spectacular line bracelet go up to auction last year: it had 16cts of OEC diamonds, beautiful engraving, and just the right length. I like a bargain, and the bidding went crazy level high, so I decided to bow out and have regretted it ever since. In the interim, I compulsively bought a half length line bracelet (featured in one of the later photos) set with old mine cuts, which are really not the best quality, although I love the engraving on its side. I genuinely didn't think I would find another like the one that got away, but fortunately an *almost* identical one appeared and hammered the other week. In truth, I thought I could get it for a (again very naively) good price as it hadn't gained much internet traction, but it went high again, and this time I obliged and won.

It is made up of 33 OEC and transitional cut diamonds (sadly the culets are pretty small, and they just aren't the chunky stones I normally prefer, but the fire is immense and very different from many of my other antique pieces). It is set in platinum with lovely engraving to both sides, with a beautiful safety clasp. I also like the links (anyone know what they are called?), which I haven't seen too often on line bracelets, however one is ever so slightly looser than the rest, so I plan to get that addressed.

They’ve been pretty responsive to me but I found out today the company said their supplier isn’t able to share a live video as it’s in their warehouse. 

From looking at the CAD, is there anything I should change?  

I’m a little nervous not being able to see it in natural light and assume I now won’t be able to unless I go ahead with the purchase and they get it from their supplier. 

It’s non certified and on sale , total with setting would be about $2400. I understand it can be cheaper to buy non-certified. 7 day return window.

The stone is about 4.5 ct, fancy vivid intensity, VS1 clarity, ideal cut, depth % is fine (I did the math), no fluorescent. I like larger rings. ",2,3,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iuxese

However, they are about this color, round cut, and are 2.3 ct each. 

Okay, so I am getting married this year to my absolutely wonderful partner of almost 10 years. We’re not doing a real ceremony because I think it’s stupid to spend $30,000+ on a singular day that, to my partner and I, seems like more stress than it’s worth. It seems much more meaningful to spend that money on like a 1-2 month honeymoon in Europe. With that being said, I am a huge geology nerd and I care about the jewelry, lol. For my something blue I was thinking sapphires and I picked out a couple of loose stones today, but I honestly don’t know what to do with them. The obvious choice would be earrings, but I just feel like 2.3ct sapphire earrings are crazy and I don’t really ever wear my hair in a way that would allow them to be seen and appreciated the way they should be. I thought like a solitaire tennis bracelet for one and then a necklace for the other, but I feel like they’re too big for a tennis bracelet. Every one that I’ve seen is using like .5 ct stones. 

Another thing that I’m running into is that I want to wear my great grandmother’s necklace as my something old (second picture). These diamonds were taken out of her engagement ring and were made into a necklace. I’m also wanting to do the sapphires in a white gold setting, so I’m wondering if I can maybe do necklace layering?? Idk. Let me know your thoughts. 

For the second sapphire, I was considering having it made into a ring for my middle finger (obviously I’d wear it on my right hand). My concern is that, at that size, it’ll be a distraction from my wedding ring, which will be a 2ct marquise cut diamond with maybe another .75ct in side stones (we did peridot for both of our engagement rings because it’s sentimental to us and will make the stones into a necklace like my great grandma did). I don’t really know though. Again, thoughts would be very appreciated. 

Also, if anyone has any other ideas on what I could do with these stones, I’d appreciate it greatly! Thank you!! ",3,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ivcaos

I was aware of Lab diamonds at the time but in the UK the only suppliers didn’t look well established or trustworthy and so so I ordered from Blue Nile. BN at the time were good value compared to retail. 

Skip forward five years and seeing the rise of LGD in the market thanks to threads like this one and I just ordered a 4.1ct, cushion, E, vvs1 diamond for a stunning $2.7k with the 18c band. So a 50% bigger diamond of higher quality for 1/5th of the price. There was a 30% already incredible prices this month. 

Suffice to say the new ring, when it arrives (6 weeks lead time on Luvansh) will be the subject of another post I’m sure but I wanted to know what you all do with the cuckold/eclipsed diamond? 

She wont want to seek it I’m certain. She’s not a necklace person and we have two young children so a costly necklace would be a mistake I feel.

I've always wanted a larger center stone, around 2.5 ct. I’m torn on whether to use my existing 1.3 ct as the center stone and risk not being happy with the final product because it's not the center size I want, or upgrade to a 2.5 lab center and I can do something else with my current stone (I was thinking of turning it into a bezel charm or necklace). I'm not sure a new lab diamond ring will feel as special as my current stone but maybe if I involve my husband more in the process it will feel more special?!

Sharing two photos of “test” rings that I purchased on Etsy on my hand for reference - which one looks better? My finger size is 6.5. I really like the 2.5 ct center.

I’m also sharing my ring inspiration photo, which features a 2.5 center stone and .5 side heart stones. I want round sides but the inspiration photo is closest to what I want.

Well she’s about to turn 11 and has told us AAAAAAACTUALLY she would like a piece of jewelry, but she wants a necklace. She is always asking to wear one of mine. It is an emerald (my birth stone) surrounded by a halo of diamonds. So I thought I’d get her something similar to that maybe for her birthday. The trouble is she has an April birthday. Her birthstone is a diamond. I’m not sure how I feel about getting an 11yo a diamond necklace.

It’s been such a struggle to find flat back earrings for my cartilage piercings since I have small ears and thin cartilage (4mm posts fit best for my helix). Plus, my spoiled skin only tolerates 18k gold or platinum.

The options available in Australia are very limited and overpriced.
Sarah &amp; Sebastian, for example; they charge AU$820 for a single 18k YG flat back earring with a 0.10ct natural diamond.
AU$2,450 for 0.25ct and  AU$5,200 for 0.50ct😂
Ridiculous, right? 
And even at those prices, they don’t offer custom post lengths, so I was always stuck with a 5mm post which was too long for me.

I was so tired of spending $$$ on pieces that didn’t fit well, so I finally commissioned a custom pair from Fiorese... and I couldn’t be happier!

I had 0.30ct round brilliant-cut lab diamonds set in 18k yellow gold bezels, made specifically for cartilage piercings with an internally threaded post (each customized in length for my helix and conch) in 18k YG.
(Fiorese can make them in any metal, but platinum was not recommended due to its softness. It can cause the screw mechanism to wear out faster?)

Instead of the usual flat disc back, I also asked them to attach a 0.10ct round brilliant-cut diamond in a bezel setting, so the back of the earring is also a diamond!

The earrings arrived today, and they are absolutely beautiful and elegant😍

Since they had to handcraft the internally threaded post and screws, we had some back-and-forth discussions about thickness and structure, but in the end, everything turned out perfect.
Compared to the Sarah &amp; Sebastian pieces I’ve worn, Fiorese pieces actually look more like fine jewellery!

Huge thanks to Melody, who made the whole process so smooth! I’m already working on another custom flat back earring🤣

She married twice and we don't know which marriage this was from.

Got it back from being valued and resized and *boy* were we in for a surprise.

The stone is, in fact, a 1.34ct Pink Purple diamond. It's so pale, but once you see it, you see it. Apparently the valuer was *very* excited about it! It has a large fracture (spotted by an eagle-eyed redditor!) which brought down the value of the ring, but we knew it would.

The rest is 6 small diamonds, 18ct gold and platinum split shoulders, made in the 1930s.

I wasn't expecting it to be very valuable. I'd done a little bit of research (mindlessly googling pretty jewellery) and thought we were probably looking at the low few thousand range, given the large fault in the diamond and the other diamonds being very small.

Well, I nearly fell over when I stopped admiring how shiny it was after its cleaning and looked down and saw that it was valued at £21.5k. Needless to say we're insuring it immediately.

Hi, I am shopping for a diamond engagement ring for my soon-to-be fiancé :)

The jeweler will do a wax model of the custom design prior to making the ring.


For a 14k yellow gold cathedral band with a platinum setting they quoted me on the following:

Ring and mounting: $3750

1st lab diamond option: $5073 

2nd lab diamond option: $1415

The 1st lab diamond option is a 4.03 F VS1 old mine cut elongated cushion with a 1.40 length/width ratio

The 2nd lab diamond option is a 4.44 G VS1 crushed ice style elongated cushion.


The total of the cheaper option for the ring and diamond would be $5165 while the total of the OMC option would be $8823.

I plan on asking these questions at the jeweler, but want to go into the discussion with some background understanding because I don’t know what I don’t know.  

I adore this ring, it’s exactly what I wanted, but also have two thumbs up to upgrade it if I want. 

Repairing tension settings. Yes or no?  Seems like it’s not advised because the integrity has been compromised.

Gelin Abaci is no longer in business and neither is the jeweler the set was purchased from (Global Diamonds). It’s my understanding Diamonds Direct bought out Global Diamonds. Conveniently I don’t have the original warranty docs/upgrade program info, but I know they existed. The stone is a GIA certified, natural diamond. Would it be common for Diamonds Direct to honor the 110% upgrade on the original stone because they bought out who the ring was originally purchased from?  If DD doesn’t, would any other jeweler let me if I used them to upgrade the whole set?

What is the catch with those 110% upgrade programs? Why would any jeweler take back my completely depreciated 8-year-old stone that would probably sell for what, $500?, because it’s not new, and just swap it out for a better quality one with a price tag of like $6k? Are my options limited to other stones that other customers upgraded from?  Should I go in and browse prices generally first so I know what they have in that price range before mentioning the upgrade?

What about the *lifetime* warranty on the original setting from either Gelin Abaci or Global Diamonds?  I assume I’m SOL on that front? The setting does have a Gelin Abaci serial number engraved in it if that matters in the slightest. 

I would love to upgrade the diamond - I believe it’s 1.5c G SI - and set it into a solitaire necklace or something. And if it can’t be repaired/warranty is useless, melt down/start from scratch with the setting and a lab grown for a new ring.  Is this crazy, doable, a bad idea?  

Any other option I should consider?

1jjdejm,jewelry,natural diamond,1742885619.0,2025-03-25,2025,3,Are Lab-Grown Diamonds the Future of Jewelry?,"I wanted to open up a discussion about a topic that's been gaining momentum in the jewelry world: lab-grown diamonds. As we've seen with the resurgence of rose gold due to its unique appeal and modern aesthetic, it seems lab-grown diamonds are also carving out their own niche within contemporary jewelry design. I believe this shift offers us an excellent opportunity for a thoughtful discussion around gems, design trends, and what these changes mean for the future of jewelry.

Lab-grown diamonds represent a fascinating intersection between cutting-edge technology and traditional craftsmanship. They offer consumers a product that is not only ethically produced but also often more affordable than natural diamonds. 

However, there's much more to discuss here beyond just the technical aspects. How do lab-grown diamonds influence our perception of value and luxury? Are they truly sustainable, and how does their production impact the environment compared to mining natural diamonds? Moreover, how might the increasing popularity of lab-grown diamonds affect the livelihoods of those who depend on diamond mining?

Let’s also consider the design implications. With the flexibility and accessibility that lab-grown diamonds provide, can we expect new trends or even entirely new styles of jewelry to emerge? How might designers push boundaries and experiment with these materials?

I’m eager to hear your thoughts on these questions and any personal experiences you may have had with lab-grown diamonds. Whether you're a seasoned jeweler, a designer exploring new materials, or simply someone who appreciates beautiful jewelry, your insights will contribute greatly to our understanding of this evolving landscape.

My wife and I are celebrating our 15-year anniversary this August (yes, she’s a saint). Back when I proposed, I got her a ring modeled after the Tiffany’s classic 6-prong platinum solitaire with a 2.2 carat natural diamond. Simple, timeless, elegant – like if Audrey Hepburn were reincarnated as a piece of jewelry.

I (oddly) can’t find a pic of our actual ring (classic husband move, I know), but I’ve attached the Tiffany’s site photos, which look nearly identical. She also has a thin diamond band that she wears on its own sometimes – think subtle sparkle, not Ice Queen.

Here’s where I need your collective brilliance: I want to do something really special for our 15th. We’re in a better financial spot now, so I’m thinking about upgrading or adding to her ring – either adding diamonds to the original solitaire, getting a new band with larger stones, or maybe something I haven’t even thought of yet because my jewelry IQ is… modest.

Some quick notes:

	•	Budget: ~$15,000 (but flexible if the idea is amazing)
	•	Prefer natural diamonds (I think she’d care – she’s sentimental like that vs lab grown but I’m open)
	•	Want something classy and timeless – not too blingy, but still a wow. 
	•	Based in NYC – likely headed to the Diamond District or maybe back to the jeweler who made the OG ring if he’s still kicking. Open to suggestions here as well. 

So what say you, experts of sparkle? What would you do with this budget and background? Upgrade the center stone by adding side stones? Swap out the band for something a little more glam? What works best in your opinion?

Bonus points for photos, links, or stories of your own upgrades/gifts. Help me earn some major anniversary points (and keep this marriage going strong for another 15)!

My wedding and engagement ring are made of 14ct white gold (and are heavily diamond encrusted). 

The white gold was rhodium plated.

I made a decision to visit a jewellery designer to request the removal of the plating. I wanted to go back to the natural white gold finish as I tend to prefer vintage jewellery and I felt the starkness of the plated finish was just not to my taste.

I collected them yesterday and she said that the finish underneath was patchy so she put a plating (yellow gold). I was assured this this plating would soften and would not need replating.

Is there anything I can do to gently soften or wear the plating in place?

1jnggu3,jewelry,natural diamond,1743352708.0,2025-03-30,2025,3,Makers/Brands known for style &amp; colors?,"Hi Reddit Jewelry!
I am very new to jewelry- as in wear none 98% of the time.
Here is my question: When people comment on a brand like Le Vian saying something to the effect of ""you are paying for the name. there are other brands that use better quality stones, etc"" Who might they be referring to? Are they saying the retail price isn't worth it but if it were priced at $500 it would be considered a good product then? 

Background info: I am already married and do not wear a ring. However, my husband has recently expressed interest in buying me a ring. I'm not opposed to this at all; I just don't have a lot of information about them. 

After shopping online and also reading a couple ring forums I'm wondering who is a jewelry brand that has similar style and regularly uses colored gems like Le Vian that is known for quality work? Asking for another brand or maybe etsy seller bc 1. I'm pretty frugal and I'll likely just be searching on sites like Poshmark to stay under $1000ish 

-I like pink, purple, brown, aquamarine, opal 

My style ranges from liking the idea of wearing just a dainty leafy band only to apparently maybe gaudy (?) or intricate? pieces. 

-I went to a pawn shop and really adored this pink stone ring on a yellow gold band. It wasn't the ring itself per say, but, I LOVED looking at the pink. And I personally felt it looked good on my skin tone. The owner shop and my husband both felt it looked like a little girls ring tho 🙃. Next was a $459 Le Vian ring like this https://www.jared.com/le-vian-natural-amethyst-ring-14-ct-tw-diamonds-14k-strawberry-gold/p/V-376367405?cid=PLA-goo-E-Commerce%20-%20PLA%20-%20LIA%20-%20P2%20-%20Collections%20-%20LeVian&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw16O_BhDNARIsAC3i2GBtyZMULDSjYRf__TIs0N98YyXa1UBITTFTPb9C-tDAFnoNGapg_goaAtR-EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds. I thought this one was very beautiful. I just preferred the pink gem more. If that had a pink stone I'd likely have bought it right then. 

This was my first time looking at any rings. Upon researching I've learned I actually really like a lot of the Le Vian rings and esp the brown diamonds (even tho others have stated they are worthless). My biggest concern about purchasing a Le Vian is I've seen people say they are not worth it...Now, idk if this is at retail price or at all. But, they often add there are better quality stones used by others. As I said, I'm not really tryna spend too much so I'd be shopping secondhand and sales. So re: Le Vian my biggest concern would just be the quality. I'm pretty heavy handed so if it's between two similar styled rings and one has a rep for high craftsmanship/quality I think I need to go with that  lifestyle wise.

One of the moderators generously shared their time in previewing my post and suggested Effy &amp; Sapphire so I will be looking into these options as well 


*One really important thing to be about this Le Vian pictured- can someone tell me how to word this when searching? i like most that the ring lays flat on my hand. I dont like the settings(?)That have a taller profile. Is this a specific setting type? 

I couldnt change the order but here was the rings i saw in person and some styles + colors I've liked

I ordered the stone during Luvansh’s Christmas sale. It’s a 3.06ct VVS2 E color Radiant. I believe the L/W ratio is 1.44. The cost was $825 out the door (no tax or shipping since I had it shipped to my parents’ house in Mississippi). This was before Calavera popped up on the scene. A similar spec’d stone on Calavera is just under $700 today. 

I gifted her the stone on Valentine’s Day so that she could have it set by our 5-year anniversary in July, and she was absolutely shocked and thrilled when she realized what our 2-year old Goddaughter had handed her. I believe her exact words were “I think I’m going to have a panic attack 😅 

She went to a local jeweler and picked out a setting for $900 or so and thankfully it was completed by her March birthday, which is when this vid was taken. She’s since gotten her ring soldered to her band. Her band is like mine (on the ashy finger above), except hers is a row of singular baguettes alternating with two round diamonds. I’ll post a picture of her previous engagement ring &amp; band combo in the comments for a better visual.

Help!,"Please someone help… I’ve been shopping for an engagement ring and somehow fell straight into the “natural diamond vs. lab-grown” rabbit hole. And wow. I did *not* expect it to be this controversial lol.

From what I’ve gathered:

• Natural = traditional, expensive, possibly sketchy origins depending on the source… but it somehow *feels* more sentimental? Maybe it’s just the legacy thing.

• Lab-grown = same sparkle, same look, waaaay less expensive (like 30-50% off), and honestly, that’s a big deal for me after I just spent $600 at the vet to be told my cat has **anxiety** 🙃

The only “con” I’m seeing for lab-grown is resale value… but like… who’s reselling an engagement ring? That seems weird to even factor in?

I think I’m leaning toward lab-grown at this point, especially after seeing one in person that had this Heart and Arrow cut. I’d never even heard of that before, but the symmetry and sparkle were *chef’s kiss*. I think the brand was called Neoshine or something? I don’t know much about them but it definitely caught my eye. They also said their diamonds are IGI certified—anyone know if that matters?

Anyway. I’m about 90% sure I’m going the lab-grown route, but I just need a little community validation before I pull the trigger. Would love to hear your thoughts. Did I miss anything?

My husband and I recently walked into a local jeweler’s shop to upgrade my engagement ring. We brought in a 1.06 ct loose lab diamond I purchased from Provence (via Lucy) to replace the original cluster setting. We also asked if they could fuse it with an enhancer ring my husband had gifted me (from Kay Jewelers—yes, I now realize that was probably overpriced, but we were clueless back then and didn’t know about overseas sourcing or websites like loosegrowndiamond.com, which I’ve learned about thanks to some amazing subs!).

The jeweler called me today and quoted $250—I’m guessing this is for labor only. I did mention I have extra white gold I can contribute if needed—like my old promise ring and another ring my husband gave me on our wedding day as part of a set—so materials shouldn’t be an issue.

I’m based in California and just wondering… does that quote sound reasonable for the work involved? Or is it a bit steep? Totally not trying to undervalue the skill, time, and craftsmanship that go into jewelry work—I have so much respect for what y’all do, especially since I’ve been lurking here for a while and learning from all the talent in this sub!

I’ll link pics of the engagement ring, enhancer, and the loose diamond I bought in the comments so you can get a visual.

simple setting, rose gold and green gemstone, engagement ring, daily use but and high sentimental value.

\- Zambian Emerald, 0.5 - 0.7ct, eye-clean, vivid green (medium-dark, no gray/brown), minor or none as treatment, Emerald/Oval, excellent/very good, polish/symmetry cut, none ( or faint) fluorescence.- Setting: Rose gold, 2mm+ band, bazel/6-prong- certification (with treatment noted)

 the jewelry shop is asking me to choose one stone to be sent to GLT Gem Lab Turkey, 

also I am not sure if I should go with Emerlad certified from that lab (gonna buy it from El Grado) or Tsavorite certified from Gübelin (or should I stick with Emerlad)?

I have zero clue about buying jewelry and really confused! my budget is about 2k euros

5.08 ct. VVS2, E color, Excellent cut, Elongated Radiant.

I wanted a classic band style, but was particular with the specifics so I worked with my jeweler to custom design the setting.

The diamond is set in platinum prongs with a gallery rail and a cathedral-style setting. The band is 18K gold with 10 four-pronged pavé diamonds and tapers from 3.3 mm to 3.1 mm. The design includes a euro shank to help the diamond stay centered. I asked for a lower cathedral to reduce the gap between the wedding band from the side.

A piece for Mother's Day and anyone who loves floral motifs! The band is a part of a floral collection  we're designing and we love that it ended up looking so beautiful next to the Peony Ring.  


This ring was all about details and trying to make design decisions that gave the ring an overall botanical/floral look. For instance, the band is rounded and a nice wide 3mm at the base, tapering up to 2mm at the shoulders--this felt like a vine or stem detail to us. We wanted the petal prongs to wrap snug around the stone, without being too bulky...like a peony just blooming. We think we chose the right color for the green diamond side stones (after so much deliberation!) and that they look like fresh green petals.   
  
  
Our master hand engraver totally nailed the finish work with beautifully hand-placed milgrain and perfectly shaped prongs. Our team is smitten with details.

We’ve been friends for like 17 years. Nothing is “set in stone” yet (get it, lol?), but I’m thinking a toi et moi with small stones, no more than 1/2 a carat per stone. I want to do one as a heart and one as a pear. Her birthstone is aquamarine and mine is diamond. Initially I was thinking of doing hers as a lab grown diamond heart with a natural aquamarine pear and then mine as an aquamarine heart and a diamond pear. I love her, but the only diamond heart I’m finding that meet my specifications (.5 carat, E VVS2, super ideal) is $825, meanwhile the 2 pear diamonds that I found (.51 carat, E VVS2, ideal) were only $272 each. I was looking for aquamarine hearts and I came across the above listing, but there’s no way in hell that’s legit, right? The other thing I’m wondering about: she’s weirdly allergic to gold? Like even 24k gives her hives. She can only wear platinum and sterling silver. I’m a yellow gold person myself so I’ll have mine made in probably 14k, but should I pony up and just do hers in platinum? I feel like doing it in silver is stupid, probably? But if I did it in silver, I would have it plated with rhodium and would be more open to doing the $825 diamond heart. Idk, y’all, help! I’m conflicted, lol.

I have a necklace that my grandmother gave me because she never wore it, and I always thought it was beautiful. It’s now in my possession. Recently, I noticed the chain is stamped with “14K” and “M*P,” so I took it to a jewelry store—not for an appraisal, but just to get it looked at. They cleaned it and said the stones are very likely diamonds, though they couldn’t confirm what the blue stones are—possibly lab-grown or real sapphires. Since the chain is real gold, they mentioned it’s likely a real gemstone too.

I’ve tried researching the maker mark “M*P” but haven’t found a clear answer, and my grandmother doesn’t know anything about its origin since it was a gift to her. The jewelry store recommended a place downtown that does appraisals for $75. I also found multiple replicas of the necklace online selling for around $1,000.

The problem is, I haven’t had a chance to wear the necklace, so I’ve been considering selling it. When I told my stepdad about the appraisal, he said, “If you already know it’s real, what’s the point of paying $75?” I told him I might want to sell it, and he seemed disappointed, which made me feel kind of guilty.

I called my grandmother to ask if she knew more about the necklace, and when I told her it might be worth something, she was happy for me and said I could keep all the money if I ever sold it. I mentioned sharing some of the money with her, and she told me that was up to me.

I don’t currently have a job, but saving up $75 for the appraisal wouldn’t be too hard. I’m just torn. If the necklace isn’t worth much, I’ll feel like I wasted my money, but I also think it’d be cool to know its value. Would it be disrespectful to sell something my grandma gave me, even though she said it was okay? And do you think it’s worth paying for the appraisal? Would also appreciate any knowledge about the necklace or what company it could be from!

* solid 14k gold
* small lab grown or recycled diamonds (as ethical as possible)

I've parsed the internet and used Reddit answers for jewelry store recommendations and then from those recs I asked chatgpt to recommend me similar. I've looked through so many that its gotten to a point where a lot of these stores that are recommended I've noticed use the same website product listing designs (mejuri style) or same exact jewelry options, which concerns me honestly.

As someone that has had a few online stores, makes me wonder how legitimate a lot of these places are and whether the prices are actually fair for what you are buying, considering they may all be sourced from the same exact place.

But now that has got me thinking if there is a way to design / tell a jeweler my own ideas for them to put it into action. If that is possible please guide me! On where to go to find said jewelers that can do these things and how to find standalone recycled or lab grown diamonds to use (small carats only).

Otherwise if not possible I would like some recommendations that fit what I am looking for (above). The BEST and closest i've gotten to the styles I like would be Quince or Ferkos, but they have unclear ethical practices with regards to diamonds.

Some stores I've gone through that more closely fit my needs were: Quince, Ferkos, vrai, narcissus

Ones I did not like for either price or style designs but were closer than most other stores: catbird, gldn, mejuri, analuisa, gorjana

Before: 2.67ct (9.72 x 6.95 x 4.72mm )lab radiant center, 2 natural half moons - 0.36cts each, set it platinum. Size 7.75

After: Replaced half moons with lab cadillacs, bezeled all 3 stones, added rondelles, beefed up the band from 1.8mm to 2.2mm. 
Size 6

At first, it felt like too much ring. The center stone seemed bigger! I’ve lost weight and maybe the finger size change altered my perception. But I got over it! I’m very happy with the changes. I wanted something more unique with both modern and vintage design elements. I’m just so dazzled by her! 

It’s not like I waited 10 years or anything. We got married in 2022. My husband was totally onboard with the changes I wanted to make and loves the new look! 😊

Credit to this sub for learning about David Klass! He was so easy to work with and did a fantastic job redesigning my ring and sourcing the new side stones. I highly recommend him and look forward to future projects with him.

That's a tungsten with a thin-ish gold ring around it, and diamonds set. The problem is, about 10 years ago, I was working on a car, pushing really hard on a ratchet and cracked it the ring. Hurt my finger bad too. It didn't actually break the whole thing - and my thought was, well this ring is imperfect, just like my marriage and I need to take better care of it. I used the crack to remind me if i'm not careful - it could fall apart. I don't mind the tungsten crack and it doesn't ever pinch or anything. I wore it for 4 years year afterward. Marriage got stronger but the ring didn't. The crack in the gold started getting bigger and i'm afraid to wear it anymore. Of course, like a lot of things it's got sentimental value and I could care less if the ring itself is monetarily worth spending money on.



Sorry for the maybe dumb question. I'm NOT at all jewelry knowledgeable. Could a jeweler maybe melt the gold back together? That crack in the gold was also there from the beginning, it's just gotten wired from wearing it so I don't wear it anymore. I'm afraid at some point the tungsten will crack in another spot and fall out.

I've lurked, read and processed a lot of information on the lab diamonds.  While my girlfriend wasn't a fan initially of the thought of lab diamonds, she now understands when seeing in person the benefits to a superior grade lab diamond to a less than superior natural diamond.

The only caveat is she'd still like to use the local family jeweler who does work with a Lab.  But I think that works out ok.

I want to try to figure out how to work with them to get the best sparkle possible.  It seems I should focus on the below.  I'm price agnostic (mostly) as I view it as saving $30K+!!!!  I can use that on the honeymoon!

Is what I have below (still figuring out the ranges) the best indicators?  I've always been a fan of Hearts and Arrow and I see some lab sites (Loose Grown) show that as an option....Just not sure I can find that with my local jeweler but will see.

Process: HPHT  
Carat: 2.5  
Color: D/E/F  
Clarity: VS1 but prefer better  
Table Range: 52.4% to 57.5%  
Depth Range:  56.88% to 63.92%  
Crown Angle Range: 33.7° to 35.8°  
Pavilion Angle Range: 40.2° to 41.25°  
Girdle Thickness: Thin – Medium

IGI certified. The symmetry is what really sold me—it catches the light beautifully without being too flashy. I wasn’t totally sure about lab-grown at first, but once I started looking into the differences, it became a pretty straightforward decision. The price definitely helped too—this one came in just under $1,000, which felt more reasonable than a lot of what I was seeing elsewhere. I found it through a smaller online shop.

We’re going to talk to a local jeweler soon, but I wanted to see if anyone would share the price of their ring so I can have an idea of what’s a reasonable price range! I’m based in Southern CA for reference.

I'm currently shopping for diamond studs (earth mined) and would love your advice.    
  
I have the opportunity to purchase a 3.5ct total weight pair (about 1.75ct each). Specs from the jeweler:

* F color
* I1 clarity (but they look stunning and seem eye clean in videos)
* GIA certified, Triple Excellent
* Cut scores of 8.2 and 8.5 on StoneAlgo
* Price is \~$19K

Originally, I had requested G/H color up to SI2 clarity (eye clean), but the jeweler shared the above with me, saying they look more like a clean SI1 and are a bit of a ""fluke"" find.  

I'm weighing whether I should go for these now, since the diamonds perform beautifully, or wait/save and buy a 2.5ct total weight pair later (\~1.25ct each), where I could probably get D–G color, VS1–VS2 clarity, also Triple Excellent with strong cut scores, at a similar budget.

I want these studs for everyday wear, not for investment or immediate resale, but quality and craftsmanship are important to me, and I want them to feel special long-term.

Would love to hear:

* Would you buy the larger stones now if they perform beautifully?
* Or would you sacrifice size to get better paper specs?
* Anyone have experience wearing and loving well-cut I1 stones daily?
* Anything you wish you knew when buying your own studs?

1kbdfar,jewelry,mined diamond,1746010071.0,2025-04-30,2025,4,EBay authenticity guarantee review,"I wanted to share my experience with this service (in the UK) because I found this information really difficult to find from actual customers. Hopefully this helps someone in future!

I was interested in an old mine cut diamond ring set in 18 ct white gold. The seller was a private seller, and I'm a private buyer, so both sides are not jewellery experts. She really didn't know much about the ring, the photos weren't great and there wasn't much info at all. It was clearly a pretty old mine cut, which I adore, and the photos made it look as if it could have been about a carat in weight. At the price I got it for, £450, this was a steal in my eyes and reddit agreed.

Normally, I wouldn't buy such an expensive piece this way but the eBay authentication service *sounded* like the perfect way to fill in the gap of my knowledge about the piece. The ring was listed over £500 but she accepted offers and the guarantee turned out to still apply even though the final purchase price was less than £500.

The piece arrived at the authenticators on a Friday morning and they wrote to me on the following Monday to say that the listing had described the ring as a champagne cut (which I had known didn't really exist) but was in fact a champagne colour. They don't grade the piece in any way - they just assess the written descriptions and the details given in the specification section of an eBay listing. They confirmed that the ring was 18ct white gold and that the stone was intact but not further. If there isn't much info there, eBay won't do much here. That's fine! But the description of the service is a bit more grandiose than that, so I wanted to be crystal clear to other people that even if you ask for follow up, they won't be drawn on any other details.

They did share a clearer photo however - so I have included that along with the initial photos.

For me, this was a relatively speculative purchase. If it had been a carat or larger, I probably would have been okish with the darker colour of the stone. But without knowing for sure, I didn't want to waste any more of my or the seller's time by having be sent on to me only for me to send it right back after taking it to a jeweller to assess properly. 

Looking at the eBay photo, I did think the carat weight looked a bit less than I was hoping for and I would rather spend the cash on resetting my existing engagement ring - a 0.65ct old European cut with a much whiter colour - than continuing to take a punt on this (probably lovely but not quite as lovely as I had hoped) diamond ring. Which I would definitely want to reset as well so just a lot more money baked in. Again, I'm a private buyer working to a budget so this was the right choice for me.

You might think I'm crazy - either to buy with so little info in the first place, or to return what you think is a gorgeous piece - and both are probably very valid! Mainly I just wanted to show what the authenticity guarantee looks like for a relatively normal buyer so do try to be reasonably kind 😉 oh and if you are interested in the ring, I'm happy to show you where to find it when the buyer relists. She was a nice lady and I'd like to help her find a good home for this eventually.",2,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbdfar

1kd8m1f,labdiamond,natural vs lab,1746211681.0,2025-05-02,2025,5,Seeking advice. Searching for the ring/stone I love the most.,"Thank you in advance for reading my lengthy post! 

Looking for some guidance! My partner and I have been looking for rings and I am trying to find what would suit me the best, but feel more overwhelmed every time we look. 

I’ve been looking at Lab and Natural stones, I have left the decision up to my partner, but would be happy with either (ethically speaking I would prefer lab, but the aspect of having a natural stone as an investment keeps coming up). 

For reference: I am fair skinned (I do tan though) and am ring size 6 1/4. I know this is something to consider when thinking about colour and size of stone. 

Cut 

Right now I am leaning towards a radiant or emerald cut, but I have also looked at elongated cushions. I find the radiant is calling to me more because of the sparkle. The emerald calls to me because I like the longer style stone, but don’t overly love how emeralds are cut/how they shine and look. (Open to so many suggestions, I haven’t seen any radiant cuts in person, only emerald). 

Ratio

I am worried about looking for an elongated stone and not getting the ratio right. I want the stone to shine as appropriately as possible. I have read about “crushed ice” vs “brilliant” and based on the research I have done elongated stones tend to take on the “crushed ice” look, but I’m not certain that is a good thing. 

Setting 

I want yellow gold for my band and have been looking at two stones on the side. Potentially a hidden halo as well. I am an active person and I want something that it set lower to my finger as I don’t want to hit it or get stuck on things. I have been looking at big rings that sit high, thinking I’d wear it to work and socially, but not around the house. My partner has indicated that he would like me to wear it as much as possible, including around the house! Which I want to take into consideration as well. 

Carat 

I want a bigger stone that is the focal point. I have tried on 2 ct (oval and emerald) and I would like something slightly bigger, but when I tried 3.2ct (oval and round) the person helping us indicated it was too big for my hand. 

Value

My partner has indicated that the budget for the ring is quite large but he would like to stay within a certain range. I know my tastes are more on the expensive side, but neither myself or my partner want to purchase something that isn’t the best value and would prefer to stay towards more economical options. Therefore finding a stone online is an option I want to explore and potentially get it fitted locally, or through an online vendor depending on the credibility. 

I have attached some images which I have been looking at but am struggling to figure out if I like them without trying them on. 

A few specific questions I have in conclusion:

How do I make sure we pick a reputable source?

What is the difference between GIA and IGI? And is one better?

Is buying online recommended? If yes, what are the best places to look?

What are best practices when searching for a ring and how do I know if I’m getting the best value? 

Thanks in advance!

They don’t do color stones, only lab diamonds, so this took a bit of a custom-made work for them, hence the price is a tad higher than you might see elsewhere.

This is inspired directly from u/Weezie_Jefferson, whose taste and collection are marvels in their own right. She posted about a moval signet that she stitched together and I had to have one for myself. 

Since I had worked with Dhruv at Ouros a previous time, instinctively I reached out to him for this project towards the end of February. I had opted for a 3.5 ct GH/VS stone, to be set in 14kt yellow gold. The stone ended up being graded at 3.80 ct with E/VS1 specs. There was no additional charge for the increased weight and better quality. The stone cutting and grading were the longest parts the process. And the actual ring crafting/setting took another 2 weeks. Shipping took about a week and I was super excited to tear apart the packaging and put this ring on. 

There’s no incentive for me to post my review. And I just wanted to share that I am a repeat customer a third time now. Ouros really excels at antique cuts and they will continue to be my go to for custom cut lab diamonds.

# Share

[](https://www.jckonline.com/writer/rob-bates/)

**By** [**Rob Bates**](https://www.jckonline.com/writer/rob-bates/) | May 01, 2025

A substantial majority of U.S. consumers are willing to buy lab-grown diamonds, although fewer of those consumers than in the past consider lab-grown their No. 1 choice, according to new survey data from [the Plumb Club](https://plumbclub.com/).

The industry organization questioned 2,000 men and women, ages 25 to 60, who have attended college and have a household income of at least $75,000 a year, for its biannual consumer poll. It found that 74% of respondents are open to receiving a lab-grown diamond engagement ring.

An even larger number—83%—said they’d be open to receiving a lab-grown diamond fashion piece. The same percentage expressed interest in other lab-grown gemstones, such as rubies, emeralds, and sapphires.



However, in a somewhat contradictory finding, more consumers than in the last survey (done in 2023) said they did not prefer manufactured gems.

Only 33% of this year’s respondents said they favored receiving a lab-grown diamond rather than a natural—down 20% from the Plumb Club’s 2023 survey. A slightly smaller number, 30%, said they’d rather get a natural (up 7% from 2023), and 37% said they didn’t have enough information to make a decision (a 13% jump from the previous survey).

When asked to choose between two diamonds of the same quality, 49% said they would prefer to buy a natural diamond, 17% chose a lab-grown, and 34% didn’t have a preference.



Plumb Club marketing director Michael O’Connor tells *JCK* he isn’t sure why fewer consumers seem to favor lab-grown product than in the past, but he notes that doesn’t always matter when they make a purchase.

“It’s interesting because more people said they are accepting of lab-grown, yet many people say they would prefer a natural diamond, and they are evenly split on whether they would buy one,” says O’Connor. “They say they would love to have a natural diamond, but the reality is they can get better quality for their money with lab.”

In the survey, 31% of respondents said price was most important factor in determining whether to buy a created gem, down from 45% two years ago. Yet roughly the same number, 30%, cited “quality difference,” meaning they could get a better color/clarity stone for their money (23% named it as the main factor in 2023). Meanwhile, 17% and 16% pointed to “ethical reasons” and “environmental reasons,” respectively—roughly even with the past poll.



The survey also found widespread consumer awareness of created gems. Some 84% of respondents said they’d heard of lab-grown diamonds, and 45% picked the correct definition of them (“identical to a natural diamond in composition and appearance, but made in a lab”), up from 41% two years ago.



The survey was conducted by the Plumb Club; Paola De Luca and her trend forecasting company, the Futurist; and polling and analytics firm Qualtrics. Certain questions were added in 2025 and cannot be compared with the 2023 study.

1kg520j,labdiamond,mined diamond,1746539627.0,2025-05-06,2025,5,Help me choose a lab diamond for the first time,"As the title says, this is my first time choosing a lab diamond. I fell in love with u/eviestephenson2011 beautiful crushed ice oval ring with the pave setting under the main stone made via Sonia @Fiorese. She was so kind to let me DM her for details of her stunner- thank you! Like, I became obsessed with it because it is absolutely stunning! Showed it to hubby and asked for it for my upcoming birthday and he spoils me and said, “Sure!” So here I am…

My original engagement ring is a 2.76 mined brilliant cut oval, DD, SI1, and it shows a fairly prominent bowtie- something I didn’t know enough to avoid when I was given this one years ago.

I’d never seen a crushed ice stone before and I wasn’t sure so I just asked for another brilliant cut. I also requested at least a 3.5 ct, D, E, or F in color, and a VS1 or better in clarity. These parameters were met. Oh, and it has a 1.40 ratio which is supposed to be premium for an oval. The actual measurements of the stone are 12.23 x 8.68 x 5.16.

I wear only white gold and to get some contrast between the white gold off the ring and the white diamond I asked for either light pink diamonds for the paves or even tourmalines.

Pics show the IGI certificate of the best main diamond offered to me. I have not been given a price on this diamond yet although I did receive a quick video and plain-as-day I see the bowtie. I really don’t want another bowtie diamond.

Here is a screenshot to the IGI certificate of the diamond in question, the short video, a link to u/eviestephenson2011 stunning ring.

What would you do in this situation? I am 61 yrs young, semi-retired business owner, with a size 10.25 ring size! I love bling and I can rock larger rocks. Help educate me and help me choose and have a gorgeous right-hand ring made please (without a bowtie)! Should I just bite the bullet and get a crushed ice cut in an effort to avoid the bowtie instead of a normal brilliant cut (which might look quite similar to my original mined diamond) or should I push for a better stone which will cost even more- even though I don’t even have a price on this one yet?

1kgqxn6,labdiamond,natural diamond,1746600539.0,2025-05-07,2025,5,Lab grown diamonds Vs natural diamonds - Our 2 cents,"Well, this debate may be a bit old but here's our 2 cents on the subject. 

A jeweler will naturally stand by natural diamonds and the supposed quality and clarity and all other specs that come with it. But lets be a bit real. We are talking about sparkly stones that people buy because it is pretty. It has no other use except for aesthetics. And it should be common knowledge that diamonds are an expense and not an investment. Sure there are some stones that appreciate in value over time and there are those that have uncommon shape, size, color or other internal features that make it more expensive over time, and there are those that are bought and sold in auctions that become more expensive over time, but the diamonds that we buy as a lay man are neither the size nor the quality that are sold in such auctions. You don't have to believe everything someone writes on the internet. All you need to do is take your diamond set to a jeweler and ask them to buy it back for a price that is higher than what you paid. If you manage to do that, then I am wrong and the whole article is a lie. In this regard I speak only in terms of stones as I am fully aware as to how high the gold prices are. 

While some still sell the idea of buying natural diamonds as an investment, I genuinely feel that investing in diamonds is akin to investing in art. Sure, Monet, MF Hussain, Van Gogh are all good investments but none of us who are reading this article have the monetary bandwidth to 'invest' in such artwork. The art we can afford can neither be auctioned nor sold again for a higher price. Same with the diamonds. 

Going by the above logic, it definitely makes a lot more sense to buy a lab grown diamond over the real one. Heck, no one will even know the difference. Even the people who buy diamonds do not buy them with the intention of selling them at a higher price later on. Since diamonds have no utilitarian value and it is strictly aesthetic, might as well buy a sparkly lab grown stone. On the contrary, diamonds have the aspirational value, and like all luxury goods, have no utilitarian value. But the only counter argument to that is, that the marketing around diamonds and other luxury goods is so extraordinarily good that people believe that they are aspirational. 

Factually speaking, around 30,000 tons of diamonds are mined annually and although majority of them are for industrial uses, thousands of tons of jewelry grade natural diamonds are still harvested annually and it really is not that rare. The diamond industry is a monopoly / oligopoly at best and only a handful of stones are auctioned in the market each year, to keep their value abnormally high. If the marketing teams of diamond companies are convincing us to attach so much emotion to these sparkly stones, then they are truly the masters of their craft and we are nothing but sheep. 

So, is it time to buy another sparkly stone to make yourself feel more valued and special? to signal to others that you are successful? After all, what good is success if no one knows you've achieved it right? or you could stop falling for the spectacularly good marketing. Buy what you love, and what looks good on you. Just because something was mined by underage and underpaid bonded laborers, doesn't make it special. Remember, it is YOU, who makes the jewelry look good. Not the other way round. 

(PS: We are not manufacturers or sellers of lab grown diamonds. We do not deal with any precious items. This is just our personal observations on the subject since we have been present in the jewelry sector for a long time. This realization is through lived experience and some people may have a different experience) ",80,68,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/labdiamond/comments/1kgqxn6/lab_grown_diamonds_vs_natural_diamonds_our_2_cents/

I'm a big fan of tennis chains and looking for some help. I'm currently searching for a **14k white gold tennis chain with lab-grown diamonds**, 20"" length and 4mm width. My budget is **up to $12k**.

I've heard good things about **Gusvilla Jewelry** and **Therealjewelry Company**, but I can’t find many detailed reviews or real customer experiences. I'm hoping some of you can share your experiences with **reliable, high-quality retailers** for these kinds of chains.

I already own silver, gold-plated, CZ, and Moissanite chains, so I'm familiar with the general look and feel. What I’ve noticed is that chains **over 33 grams** tend to feel more premium and substantial, which is something I value a lot in higher-end pieces.

It was gorgeous outside and my neighbor and her husband invited the cul-de-sac over for a little cookout. 

Our newest set of neighbors is a younger family  (late 20s, two children under five). 

Not that it matters, but she had a very small Diamond on her finger. I would’ve assume .5ctw (not judging, it’s important for the story). I don’t have a ring at all because my fiancé has my ring in production, and we were having a conversation about rings. (Betty and I) 

27F new neighbor walks up (let’s call her Carrie), listens for a moment, and then weighs in immediately with “it makes me so mad that so many girls are walking around with huge fake rocks now. I’m so glad I went smaller but real.”

Betty said “how do you know they’re fake just because they’re big?”, Carrie scoffed and said “because you can just tell, based on their lifestyle!”

Betty says: “ your logic makes no sense because I have a larger diamond and you have a smaller one and we have the same lifestyle. We live on the same cul-de-sac in our houses are worth almost exactly the same. We are very similar cars..” 

Carrie said “ well isn’t yours a lab??” Betty says “no it’s natural.”

Made me laugh so hard because people are so shitty about this for no reason. Betty and her husband are both engineers from Germany who have no children. 

But they live in the same area, drive the same cars and have very similar lifestyles. To assume that no one has money because you don’t have money is so ridiculous. And to assume that any Diamond bigger than 1.5 is “fake” (she means lab, and yes I went on to correct her), is atrocious. 

Anyway: get the 4 ct. Nobody knows you didn’t inherit a bunch of money, or just live a frugal life and saved money for it. You only live once.

My fiancé bought me a 5 carat lab diamond ring and I absolutely adore it but I have unexpectedly been on the receiving end of some shocked looks and socially awkward comments. Apparently lab diamond prices are not yet common knowledge around me! 

While my fiancé’s income is high (600K) and many of his colleagues have massive diamonds (we aren’t close enough to know whether mined or lab, but I assume a mix of both due to ages), we both grew up in middle class families where 1-1.5 ct was the standard diamond size. This is more representative of rings in our larger friend group. We live in a major Canadian city. 

So here are my main questions:
-Is shrinkage real? This ring looks SO big to me right now but I keep hearing that I’ll get used to it. 
-Do you ever feel awkward or guilty around friends/family that assume you spent major major money on a ring? 
-Do you get questions and comments from strangers on a regular basis, or was this just coincidence for me? 

Kinda don’t want to have to educate everyone around me. Kinda don’t want my friends to assume I have tons of disposable income. Kinda don’t want people asking if my ring is “fake”. Kinda just want people to fuck off so I can enjoy my ring. 😝

Edited to add: I have big hands, my ring finger is size 7.75, and I do adore the ring. 😆 ",72,163,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/labdiamond/comments/1kkjj4z/for_ladies_who_rock_big_rocks_help_my_social/

We were completely alone overlooking the snow-covered landscape and he said “This moment is so perfect, I would propose to you right now if I had a ring.” “I don’t care if you have a ring,” I said. So he dropped down on one knee and asked. It was incredibly romantic, but I have been wearing a $100 ring we picked out at an antique store as a placeholder for the last six months.

Me and my partner have been busy moving in together so i haven’t been keeping great track of the date. Our anniversary is coming up on June 9th and i decided a while back that i would be getting her a promise ring for our anniversary so it’s crunch time.

She’s not a huge fan of wearing rings though this is something we have already talked about before. Considering she doesn’t like rings all that much in general i want to get her something more low profile.

Our birth stones are Ruby (hers) and Diamond (mine). She prefers gold over silver and i’ve already gotten her a few pieces in gold so preferably the ring would be gold as well.

My budget is $1000-1500. Obviously if something is higher quality with good value closer to the $1500 range im fine with that, but if the difference comes down to something like the clarity or the stones im fine saving the money for something else since at that price im sure the stones will already be too small to notice blemishes unless looking at them under magnification.

I’ve been looking around but considering this is the most i’ve spent on a piece of jewelry i want to make sure its at least from a reputable brand that sells a good value-for-money product with good customer support if future assistance is needed.

Even if you just drop a brand name for me to check out, it’s appreciated. Thanks!",1,0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/1kpajhz/promise_ring_east_canada/

In local jewellers, the only OECs I've tried on are pre-loved (i.e. in pawn shops) and I've also been peeking at older ladies hands and seeing their lovely OECs.

I've been trying to find out as much as I can about OEC before buying (before my Fiance buys!) - afterall, I have to look at this ring for the rest of my life! 

I have been looking at loose stones on Calavera then cross checking the specs on other sites. So far it seems like Calavera has the most OECs.

  
So my questions:

This is one I've found I'm thinking of buying: [https://www.igi.org/verify-your-report/?r=585326762](https://www.igi.org/verify-your-report/?r=585326762) Any feedback/thoughts?

Are there any specs I should be looking for?

At the moment I'm trying to follow this advice: [https://www.gemsociety.org/article/old-european-cut-diamonds/](https://www.gemsociety.org/article/old-european-cut-diamonds/)

With the main thing being - Excellent Symmetry and ratio of 1.05 or below.

Other than that I'm not too worried about the colour as every lab diamond I've ever seen in real life looks white enough for me. And I actually don't mind the yellowish tint that mined OECs have. I don't even mind the lack of sparkle - I just love the look of the cut.

Is it important that it is HPPT rather than CVD?

Is there anywhere else I should be looking to get a wider inventory? There are very few OECs in the world it seems. 

I'm looking for my fiance to spend less than £1100 (including any shipping, taxes etc)

4-29 Linda sent the CAD for the rings and I made a small change to have the stones set lower by having them open on the bottom. She advised it would collect more dirt this way, which I agreed but ultimately I really wanted a lower profile. 
4-30 she sent over the updated CAD and I approved it and paid the new balance. Since there was a holiday at this time Linda let me know when they would get started on the work. 
5-15 the ring was finished, she sent pictures and video for approval and shipped it the very next day. 
5-19 DHL contacted me with a bill for “shipment related fees” $47. Linda declared the order was $60 and she told me the bill would probably be about $18, but that’s definitely not her fault.

I’ve gotten a comment here and there from people who are either never going to get married or got married a long time ago before lab diamonds got their popularity so they don’t know anything about lab diamonds. If it were a natural diamond, obvi it’d be much more expensive. They’re polite and all, nice people who  don’t make an obvious comment but it has slipped when they say stuff to the effect of “huge rock”. They’re not coming from a malicious place, just they notice it’s “bigger” because lab diamonds aren’t common to them. 

Honestly, that makes me feel self-conscious. It’s a modest ring, fits my hand well and all that but I am not a flashy person at all and I consider myself someone who lives within her means, showing off any type of wealth doesn’t matter to me that’s not where I find value in life (not that I or my fiance are wealthy - we float around in the middle class). My fiance and I picked out my ring together, he has a friend in the jewelry business and gave us an amazing offer on a beautiful ring, really helped us out and I appreciate that.

1ksaae2,EngagementRings,natural vs lab,1747864414.0,2025-05-21,2025,5,4ct Radiant from With Clarity — Would love your thoughts,"

Hey everyone,

Wanted to share my experience with With Clarity and the final ring I ended up with — and honestly, would love your thoughts. I’m proposing in a few weeks while we’re in Puerto Rico, and I’ve put a lot of time and thought into getting this right.

The ring is a 4ct radiant lab-grown diamond set in a 14k yellow gold double hidden halo setting. I was able to price match the diamond from Calavera, and With Clarity was really easy to work with throughout the process. They gave me CAD renderings, kept me updated on the timeline, and everything was delivered fast and securely. The whole experience felt smooth and low-pressure, which I appreciated as someone who doesn’t know a ton about jewelry going in.

I tried to be intentional with the specs — aiming for great proportions, finger coverage, and overall balance. I went with 14k for durability and added a personal engraving on the inside.

The ring just arrived, and I’ve attached  a quick video. I’m happy with how it turned out, but naturally I’m also second-guessing everything — so I figured I’d throw it out here to see what you all think.

Would love your honest feedback.

Thanks in advance!

I'd like our wedding bands to be something we could potentially comfortably wear 24/7, could be resized in future, and won't look bad when they get scratches.

What research I've done seems to suggest comfort fit court rings as a good bet? I suppose 18k would be fine (or even 22k? I have indian background). Not sure what finish. Shiny seems to me like it will look bad quite fast.

I also like the idea of some diamonds in mine. But would this be less comfortable and also less durable?

I have had this ring ever since, but never knew what to do with it. I’m looking for some advice and ideas on if I should and how to go about giving this piece new life. 

We were very close and having it felt a little painful if I’m being honest. She always wore her rings so it felt so deeply personal that having it or trying it on felt a little intrusive to her if that makes any sense. 

The story I have heard goes… When my grandmother and grandfather got engaged they had only met a couple of times and had a short-term but long distance courtship via letters. My grandfather came from humble means and bought her a simple wedding band (no diamond). Many years into their marriage, my grandfather bought her a diamond engagement ring to complete her set, and she asked to have the two rings fused together as one. So technically this ring is two rings. I can see two different makers marks on the inside. 

As I said above, I’ve had this ring many years kept in a ring box because I simply didn’t know what to do with it. I think I am finally in a place where I fully accept and understand that she wanted me to have it and that is why she left it to me. I don’t think she would want me to keep it tucked away in a box forever. 

So lovely people of Reddit, I’m very open to any recommendations, feedback or ideas. Should I keep it as its and not wear it often (it only fits on my left ring finger)? Or use the stone to make something new? Or is there a way to repurpose the band as well? Any advice is very greatly appreciated. 

Thank you… and please ignore my grown out nails. I have an appointment for a fill tomorrow! 🙏

1ktx5g6,labdiamond,natural diamond,1748041337.0,2025-05-23,2025,5,A good experience (Luvansh),"Wanted to share my experience with a recent purchase from Luvansh. I’ve seen mixed reviews, so it seemed like more actual feedback and input would be good at helping guide folks to an educated purchase!

The Mother’s Day special was hard to miss - 40% off essentially. So I had to pull the trigger. 

I originally order the 14k tennis necklace at 10ctw it comes 17”. I figured it would be tight for me (I’m a dude and usually wear 20-22”). Since they offer a 30 day return period, but void of resized before receiving, I figured I’d order and see then send back for resizing.

It shipped incredibly fast - they probably had them in stock. It was next day delivery. 

The item itself was beautiful. For the price. I have a diamond tennis bracelet that’s D-E VVS and I could definitely tell a slight difference in sparkle. Barely noticeable unless heals under certain light - also my bracelet the diamonds are bigger so that could play a factor.

I took it to two jewelers here and they confirmed they were indeed lab diamonds. And even hinted at the inclusions. It’s advertised as F G SI btw, so that aligns.

Naturally I was satisfied with what I received but wanted to add 3” to make it 20” total. I decided to upgrade to the 14 ctw from 10 and add 3”. This process was super easy and I was in frequent communication with the Luvansh support team.

I felt like communication was spot on - they sent a separate invoice for the 3” addition and instructed me on how to place the order. 

A custom piece like this did take about 10 days to ship but it was overnight after.

It’s beautiful in my opinion. And I’m glad I took a leap of faith on it. 

The diamonds are as advertised and yes when compared to a VVS stone you can tell if you really try.

All around I personally had a great experience.

Hope y’all find my information useful.

Other things: the 10ctw necklace is about 3 mm thick
The 14 ctw is just over 3mm but not quite 4mm

I’ve noticed rolling but I think that’s the name of the game. No biggie.

https://www.reddit.com/r/labdiamond/s/UN518uWtti

It started with a group buy for a tennis bracelet. This wasn’t my first order from them, (I had ordered a group buy ring from golden bird which I loved) and still use, so when I saw the tennis bracelet group buy from Ouros was announced, I ordered one and was contacted by Aman. 

It went pretty smoothly, took a few weeks, and they kept me updated throughout process. 

Order Details:
 Jewelry Type: Tennis Bracelet 
 Diamond Details: Round Cut Lab Grown Diamond 
3.30 MM (Each) 
 5.39 TCW (Approx) 
EF/VS
Metal: 10K Yellow Gold 
Length: 6.50 Inches

1535 USD For Bracelet 
50 USD For PayPal Fee 
30 USD For Shipping Charge 
-------------------------------
1615 USD Total Amount




The bracelet was so sparkly and beautiful, but the links/metal settings were weak, and it broke on the first Day of wear (April 18th) 

I reached out to Aman who didn’t respond until I emailed Vijay (the owner?) after days of back and forth, they sent me a shipping label to have it sent it to their contact? In NY for a fix.
Shipping Label received after multiple follow ups on April 22nd
I sent it on 26th
It was delivered on April 28th


Aman initially tried to give me to take it to a reputable jeweler, and they would hear the cost. I refused because if the jeweler had done something they didn’t like, they could use that as an excuse + my work schedule doesn’t allow me that kind of flexibility. 

It was sent back to me and was delivered on May 8th. 

I wore it maybe every other day? Since then. 
Never wore it sleep, shower or anything. 

Literally just go work, or date night. 

Today is May 26th and I was having a patio lunch, I felt something come loose of my wrist; before I could catch it, I watched it fall, and slip into one of the road drainages. 

$1,615 gone literally down the drain. 

It sparkled beautifully but the links weren’t sturdy from then skimping on quality of the metal. 

Because i can’t retrieve the bracelet, I don’t even know if I can get a refund or not. 

This is my last order with Ouros. 

All of these are documented via email and WhatsApp.

- Option 2: ~1.7 carats, smaller but with noticeably better clarity (pic 2&amp;3)

The only two things she’s told me are that she really loves cushion cuts, and that she prefers a natural diamond over lab-grown. Both options I’m considering are natural and cushion cut, so I’ve got that part down — now I’m just torn between size and clarity.

From what I can tell, both diamonds look great in photos, but I know pictures can be misleading.

So my questions are:
- Is there a clear winner between size vs. clarity at this price point?
- Is it just a matter of personal preference, or is there a better value to be had here?
- Are either of these “good deals” or should I keep looking?

I want her to love the ring, and I also want to make a smart, informed decision. I’d be grateful for any insights, tips, or things I should be considering before pulling the trigger.

Thanks in advance!

1kxuzgh,EngagementRings,natural vs lab,1748472444.0,2025-05-28,2025,5,What diamond option should I consider?,"Hi everyone!! 
(Long time creeper, first time poster)

I’m getting engaged soon (yay!) and my partner and I have been looking at engagement rings. We visited two local jewelers, and one really stood out. They had a wide selection and carried multiple designers. I completely fell in love with one particular ring (picture 1). It’s truly “The One” for me. It truly feels like me and my boyfriend even said that he loved it and how my face lit up when I put it on. 

I’m a chemist and we both have good jobs. With that said, from a scientific and ethical standpoint, I’m 100% comfortable with lab-grown diamonds. Chemically, they’re identical to natural ones, but the price differences are hard to ignore. My boyfriend decided on a budget a month ago and we’re working with $5k–$8k. At the most, $10k! This budget needs to include any customization, account for the rising cost of gold, and ideally a wedding band. 

I went back to the jeweler to explore options and found out the exact ring I love is actually for sale BUT it’s a natural diamond ring priced at $16,500. They haven’t updated it for current gold prices and that was definitely a selling point they tried to emphasize. The center diamond is a 2.01ct K color, and I genuinely love the warmth of the diamond and the ring. The side stones match it beautifully. There’s a hidden halo which I’m neutral on. Not a major selling point for me. 

The price, though, is just too high? I mean it would wipe out our savings and set us back financially since we watch to buy a house next year. We could do it though. So I asked about recreating the same ring in 14k yellow gold using lab-grown diamonds and maybe a smaller center stone. They quoted me $2,000 for the mounting alone and that reflects today’s current gold prices.

The original center diamond alone is $12,000. We looked at some lab options, but most were very white and bright (D–E color - picture 2) and that lovely warmth I loved was totally lost (picture 3). The jeweler found some H color lab diamonds (picture 4), which are a bit better, but I noticed they sometimes looked a little gray in certain lighting (picture 5). *Note*: This round diamond is just for display but they can get a cushion cut lab grown diamond in H color. So after getting these photos, I was quite honestly disappointed. The sales associate said that’s the lowest color that they could procure in a lab grown cushion cut.

To get closer to the warmth I loved, she wants to show me a natural 1.7ct J color diamond for $7,000. They could match the side stones to keep the same warm, cohesive look (no picture yet). This was also disappointing since I had my eye on lab grown to begin with. 

So here are the options we’re weighing:

	1.	Buy the original ring — $16,500 but it would be a major financial stretch and derail our financial goals. No room for customization but it’s in my size 
	2.	Recreate it with a 1.7ct natural J diamond — roughly $10k–$12k, which is more manageable but still above budget. Not super important to me to have a natural diamond but that warmth is kept and I’m very happy with the color.  
	3.	Go lab-grown — more affordable, but the best color options they’ve shown (H color) might not give me the warmth I love (picture 6 - other mountings with lab grown diamonds in D color)
    4.     Other Jeweler  — Keep looking for another jeweler that can make it all possible? Is that possible? Can they technically take the design of the mounting and find the lab diamonds I want? 

A few questions I’d love help with as well:
	•	Would you go with a ring that’s perfect now but financially heavy, or choose a slightly different version that’s more responsible?
	•	Is it actually possible to find lab-grown diamonds with that warm yellow/pale yellow tone (like J or K)? Or is this jeweler nudging me toward a natural diamond unnecessarily?
	•	Also, any thoughts on cathedral vs. flush settings for pairing with a wedding band later? 

I really want something I’ll love for 10+ years (ideally forever). I’m torn between what’s practical and what’s perfect.

Would love your thoughts and advice!! Xo ",16,32,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kxuzgh

I personally gravitate towards diamonds that are graded good, fair &amp; sometimes even poor.

For the majority, modern round brilliants with triple EX and/or AGS light performance scores, et al., seem to dictate value.  Everyone pushes ideal specs, which I'm truly not a fan of. I cannot stand hearts &amp; arrows. I wish I loved them but I don't. Those are the diamonds that you look AT to admire their fire &amp; flash. I prefer diamonds that I can look IN to and get lost in their beauty. I absolutely love wide tables (minus the fish eye.) I even like frosted girdles. 

My favorite is the old checkerboard transitional or circular brilliant, which, at best is graded ""good"" but often fair to poor. The first pic isn't a transitional per say, but it's an example of a 3ct SI/H, GIA ""fair"" cut diamond, which I will choose over an ideal cut 1000% of the time. It's just my preference.

Who dictates what an ""ideal"" round cut is for *everyone?* Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, no?
I understand having standards and they do matter, but H&amp;A, light performance, scores, etc., is a bunch of marketing hype, IMO.

The same goes for clarity. I don't want a diamond with surface reaching inclusions, haziness or a ton of black carbon peppered everywhere, but not all I1s or even I2s are structurally comprised, frozen spitballs. I think there is a misconception about I grades. What are often sold as I clarity are far below that, they're commercial garbage.

People need to educate themselves and make an educated decision, but there ARE clean, beautiful  stones out there that don't fall within the VS or ideal cut range. Good I1 or I2s aren't in abundant supply but they're not unicorns.  They can be bought right and for less than their VS or SI counterparts. 

Pics #2 and #3 are of a good quality 3.22 ct GIA VG/VG/VG, G color I2 diamond. I bought it right. My former business partner who owns a brick &amp; mortar store in Florida has been trying to buy it from me for 3 years. The offending imperfection is a large needle that doesn't reach the surface. There isn't any carbon or haziness. To the average person, it's an eye clean beautiful stone. 

Not everyone wants, needs or can afford a VVS/D RB natural diamond with ideal specs. I can afford them but don't want them. If that were my gig, I'd get a lab and call it a day.

Its disheartening when I see people come here for advice with a GIA cert in hand showing a VS or SI GHI triple EX diamond and get told to pass on it because of specs or something innocuous like ""clouds and pinpoints not shown."" The price isn't even mentioned. How do you know if they should pass on ANY diamond without knowing the price?

Anyway, for the average consumer, know what you're buying and buy what you love. An ""imperfect"" diamond or a diamond outside of ideal proportions isn't for everyone, but that certainly doesn't mean they're not worth owning.

Off my soapbox.

1kytytz,jewelry,natural vs lab,1748574678.0,2025-05-30,2025,5,Thinking of buying a jade bangle? Here’s what I wish more buyers knew (from 10 years of mistakes),"Hi everyone,

I've been collecting and wearing jadeite jewelry for over 10 years — mostly bangles, pendants, and a few custom pieces. It started as a personal interest, but over time I’ve made lots of costly mistakes that taught me what to look for… and what to avoid.

Recently, my mom and some of her American friends started getting into jade too — mostly through online platforms and social media. They keep sending me listings and asking, “Is this a good one?” or “Why did mine crack?”

So I figured I'd make a post to share a few things I’ve learned the hard way, in case it’s helpful to others who are curious about jade but unsure how to judge quality.

[A lavender bangle with a clear internal fracture](https://preview.redd.it/bpnn3zjx5u3f1.jpg?width=1575&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=221f29e7ebd76ea4c86518d07e219612bb2dccf3)

Often marketed as “natural line” or “texture,” but this is actually a structural crack. It weakens the bangle and increases breakage risk. Good sellers should disclose this, but many don’t.

[A green bangle with a surface flaw, often called a “sand eye](https://preview.redd.it/ir0nn6q06u3f1.jpg?width=1575&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=599bfdca5f1397d2e2e684ff77be69090a16f5bd)

This comes from poor raw material and would be considered a major defect in traditional jade grading. Some listings gloss over this by calling it “unique character.”

If you're new to jade, here are some tips:

\- Natural jadeite (aka A-grade) is chemically untreated — it’s what you want long-term

\- B-grade and C-grade jade may look good in photos, but they’re chemically processed and prone to cracking or fading

\- Always ask for side lighting photos, and don’t rely on certificates unless they’re from trusted labs

Happy to answer any questions.

Let me know if this kind of post is welcome here — and thank you for reading!

Moving away from the traditional 4Cs system—cut, color, clarity, and carat weight—GIA will now categorize lab-grown diamonds more broadly as either “premium” or “standard,” or provide no grade if the quality is subpar.  ￼

This shift underscores the fundamental differences between natural and lab-grown diamonds. Natural diamonds are unique, formed over billions of years under the Earth’s surface, each with distinct characteristics. In contrast, lab-grown diamonds are mass-produced using methods like High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) or Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), resulting in stones that often fall within a narrow range of color and clarity.  ￼ ￼

By simplifying the grading system for lab-grown diamonds, GIA aims to clarify the distinction between these and natural diamonds, emphasizing the rarity and individuality of natural stones. This change is expected to influence consumer perception and the broader diamond market. ",37,40,0.83,https://www.naturaldiamonds.com/engagement-rings/lab-grown-diamond-grading/

[How acid treatment and polymer injection alter jade](https://preview.redd.it/9op39e9xtm4f1.png?width=1116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c83e811e99b844330cfbb51a10173aa7defa0cff)

[Real vs treated jade textures under light](https://preview.redd.it/bykrkr30um4f1.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fd398b4749b91c941e5594056a5d7a107d6f15c)

Let’s talk about a common trick used to make low-quality jade look high-end: **Acid washing + polymer injection.**  
It’s not just a makeover — it’s a chemical transformation.

**What is acid-washed jade?** Acid washing is a treatment where jade is soaked in strong acid to “clean out” impurities. The result? The stone *looks* clearer — but the internal crystal structure is completely damaged. (Think: sponge or honeycomb.)

**Why inject glue afterward?** Because acid-washed jade becomes brittle like chalk. So, they inject it with **epoxy resin** to hold it together and make it look shiny and smooth again.

These are often sold as “jadeite” but are technically **B-grade or even C-grade** jade.  
And the price? Way lower than untreated natural jade.

How can you tell it’s fake or treated?Here are some key signs:

* **Acid webbing texture:** looks like spiderwebs under light.
* **Unnatural gloss:** plastic-like shine under flashlight.
* **Resin net patterns:** especially visible after injection.
* **False brightness:** the color glows in a strange way — too “green,” too “even.”

​N**atural jadeite (Grade A)** has:

* Soft glow, not harsh brightness.
* Cotton-like internal fibers, not sharp webbing.
* Uneven, organic color transitions.

**Final tip:** If it’s super cheap, super bright, and looks too perfect — it’s probably chemically enhanced. Real jade has depth, texture, and an energy you can feel.",44,14,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/1l21yu7/how_to_spot_acidtreated_and_polymerinjected_jade/

However what’s tearing me is that one is mad made, the other is natural. Like buying a quartz worktop or marble which favours the natural bias. Quartz can literally mirror marble effects with even better performance. However, then you have comparisons like; ice from a glacier or stuff from the supermarket to cool your drink. That favours the lab stuff. 

I’ve also been quoted VS2 G colour with triple excellent for £7,000 ( natural ) and SI2 G colour triple excellent for £5,300 (natural). Would you say these are reasonable price tags. 

Specs are 1.5ct diamond with 18k yellow gold ring (6claws). 

I would love to know your opinions.

1l4luif,Diamonds,mined diamond,1749192447.0,2025-06-06,2025,6,Wedding Ring Dilemma: Natural vs. Lab vs. Vintage vs. Sanity,"I’ve officially entered the trenches trying to figure out what direction to go for a wedding ring, and wow, this industry is no joke. One thing I do know: GIA is king, and navigating this space is way harder than I expected.

I’m pretty set on getting a custom band. I love the idea of something with character that feels a little more personal and unique.

Lab vs Natural
This has been my biggest internal debate. I love the idea of an heirloom ring, something that holds at least some level of value. From what I understand, lab-grown diamonds currently have no resale value, while a natural diamond loses about 35% immediately after purchase.

I also get that to buy a natural diamond that actually holds value, you're likely looking at $20,000 or more. That’s a huge amount to lose if the ring ever goes missing. Sure, you can get insurance, but I also know how insurance companies can be when you actually need them. That alone makes me second guess the whole thing.

I don’t have a problem with lab diamonds in terms of quality (they're chemically identical), but what bugs me is that even most jewelers won’t buy them back. So if you spend $8,000 on one, there’s a good chance it’ll be worth zero if you ever need to resell.

Vintage / Old Mine Cuts
Then there’s the vintage route. I don’t hate it. I’ve looked into old mine cut diamonds, but most of the sites I’ve found are hard to navigate, the certifications are all over the place, and the stones often don’t have the same sparkle as modern cuts. Yet somehow, they’re priced like modern naturals.

So what now?
At this point, it feels like every option has its own red flags. I’ve even briefly considered sapphires, but that feels like a whole other rabbit hole and I’m too far down the diamond path now.

I’d love to hear what others ended up doing, especially if you felt like every direction was the wrong direction. What helped you decide?

I would really appreciate any advice or suggested vendors to purchase an old mine cut moval lab diamond. I’m in the US but don’t mind purchasing elsewhere if it is a reputable source.

Below are the specs from the initial stone I was going to purchase. Another shop (local) later gave the ballpark of $3-3.4k from their vendor but to let him know if I find a better price elsewhere because the vendor could be flexible.

I just want to know what’s an appropriate amount to spend on a ring? Ik about the 2 month salary rule which is from advertisements and such. I’d also get a lab grown diamond over a natural one.

It’s going to be 2mm wide a band with some extra diamonds in a cluster on each side on size 5.5. 

I think 14k is best for us for long term durability, but I like the natural diamond because I like the idea of it being valuable over time rather than worthless (lab will have no value imo) Also I know they’re visually the same, but I like to think the medium blue fluorescence on a D color diamond makes it pretty unique. I know the yellow gold makes it easier to go down in color, but when I was shopping for diamonds I could easily see the difference in the colors and I like the idea of it being a colorless clear diamond with still a medium blue fluorescence. Enough to get the pros without the cons. 

The only thing I’m concerned about is VS2. I know it’s GIA so they tend to grade higher but I can see details up close pretty well. Will I be happy with this? Will I be able to easily see those inclusions? The comment says “Clouds, pinpoints, internal graining and surface graining are not shown.”

Also I know the diamond is fairly small for some people on Reddit but I think for a size 5.5 Natural Oval, it almost makes it look more delicate and precious.

I'm getting engaged soon (!!!!!) and my boyfriend and I are currently wrapping up the process of designing a ring. The center stone will be a 0.96 carat natural diamond that has been passed down from my grandmother to my mom, and now to me. The accent stones in the ring will be lab-grown. Because we're getting the center stone for free, and I'm not a very sparkly-jewelry-person, the total cost of the ring will be pretty low. We don't know the actual monetary value of the center stone (haven't gotten it officially appraised), but even besides that, the sentimental value is, in my opinion, priceless.

I'm sure our jeweler won't offer a warranty on the center stone since we're bringing it ourselves, but what should we look into getting? Is it some sort of warranty, or proper insurance? My jeweler *does* offer some sort of first-year-repairs-are-free thing, and then lifetime repairs have a ""nominal fee"", is that reasonable? What *should* my jeweler offer re: replacing stones that wouldn't be scammy? How much should I expect to pay for some sort of policy on a stone/ring of that quality? Where did y'all get your insurance, and do you recommend them?

Thanks in advance for any help y'all can offer! I'm super nervous and just want to make sure I do it all right and take care of my future ring as best I can ;-;",2,7,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamonds/comments/1l975wb/insurance_warranty_how_to_protect_an_heirloom/

I have a relatively new less than 1-2 months old tennis bracelet, lab grown diamonds in sterling silver. About a week or so ago I had it snap in half. With enough force to not once leave a giant bruise on my arm but also bend numerous of the links. I thankfully have insurance, with it being so new, I worry that not only may it need a new setting but it also isn’t going to be able to be fully restored to before condition which was practically brand new. I’d much rather insurance pay to replace it than repair it as I’d be walking on glass if it’s just repaired. I can see numerous links that are stretched or bent (not sure if that’s the right word). Looking for advice on what type of jeweler I should bring it to. The two I’ve brought it to so far have said: 

1. Yea it can be repaired it won’t ever be the same as it was before but that’s between you and your insurance. Essentially refusing to put that in writing, which is kind their job…..?

2.  Yea it can be repaired with soldering, didn’t have a bench jeweler or examine it for more than a few seconds. When I asked about the structural integrity of it, the jeweler was a real jackass and shrugged his shoulders and said in a rude tone “it’s sterling silver what do you expect”

The way I went about designing my ring was I went to a store, saw a diamond engagement ring I liked, and then requested that they make a version of that ring w a sapphire instead. I made some suggestions to the CAD they sent me.

And then I went in person to pick out the exact sapphire for the center stone, they showed me about 6-7 options for the sapphire, and one stood out to me. I went with that one.

I loved the sapphire in the store

I even loved the engagement ring the very first time I saw it when I went to pick it up at the store 

But the second I took it home I’ve been feeling off about the exact sapphire color- idk if I’m being nuts but I non stop think about the color of my sapphire and how it feels off to me 

I don’t think I like the way my sapphire ring looks inside my flat- I tend to like what it looks like better when I’m outside 

I’m also convinced I overpaid for the ring which sends me into a tizzy- we paid like 4.5 gbp (about 6k usd) for a 1.98 mined/natural sapphire ring w 1.5 carats of mined/natural diamond on a platinum band.

It only took 10 years! 😂 But he designed it himself and I really didn't know how to bring it up. Now that our 10 year wedding anni (20 years together) is approaching, I thought it might be time for a redo and he is super understanding.

He picked this gorgeous 1.24 ct cushion cut diamond, E/VVS2. It's really a beautiful stone, but I've always felt like the setting doesn't do it justice. I think it's set too low, the band is too thick, I don't love the channel band, and I think the ring overall takes away from the center stone. It doesn't sparkle the way it should.

The thing is for the cost to re-design and re-set it, I could just get a much larger lab diamond. 

Obviously there is sentimentality to this diamond, but I'm wondering if it's worth putting another 3-4k into it and if that will satisfy my in the long run.

1lapv4u,Diamonds,natural vs lab,1749845552.0,2025-06-13,2025,6,Worst Jeweler Experience Ever,"So I finally got my center stone and new setting to go set at a jeweler in person. I bought the center stone GIA certified from rate carat and the setting custom CAD designed and made for the diamond dimensions with a reputable Etsy jeweler.

I took it to a brick and mortar goldsmith 20 mins from my house and, oh. My. God. I even called ahead to ask if they can set it knowing the prongs are a bit long and will need cutting and shaping, and they said they could. But I was not prepared for these ladies to act like I was swindled and the scare tactics they tried.

I told them I would like it set in the ring and the first thing they said was, “well, your setting looks a lot like one of ours we make.” No, it didn’t. It has pink diamonds. But whatever.

Then one of the ancient old ladies takes my diamond out of its box and starts using a shitty diamond tester on it, dropping it on the table over and over and over. I started to get really pissed off because it was nearly $2,000 she kept dropping carelessly. The diamond tester kept squealing diamond, but then she looked up at me and tried to act like she was delivering some awful news.

“I’m sorry but I tested your diamond and it shows that it’s likely a moissanite.” Okay, first of all, no it isn’t. Second of all, just put the FRIES IN THE BAG! I wanted it set in my ring. I didn’t come to the store to get lied to. She then picked up my setting and used it on the pink diamonds and said, “yeah, those are coming back lab diamond.”

One of the other ancients came over and looked at the ring and asked if the first ancient used the new diamond tester they had, and she said she did. Then she turned it to her own jewelry and it flashed moissanite, too. And she looked over and said, “oh, I don’t think it’s working.” So she gave up and sat down in the back after that.
 
By this point I got fed up with the entire interaction. I decided I didn’t care what setting fee deal they had, I wanted to leave. They were too incompetent and what was the purpose??? They were wrong, and they were dumb, and if they had played things correctly they could have gotten me to design a wedding band with them but they were too dumb!

I then took my ring and stone to a second jeweler who confirmed the center is a natural diamond, while he couldn’t test the pink diamonds because they require special equipment to see if they’re lab (they’re not.). So I don’t know what baloney test those women ran to come to the conclusion that they were lab.

TLDR; dumb jeweler tested my stones without me asking them to, misclassified them, and I decided not to even get my stone set with them because it pissed me off that much.",33,86,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamonds/comments/1lapv4u/worst_jeweler_experience_ever/

1lcefu6,jewelry,mined diamond,1750030958.0,2025-06-15,2025,6,4 Custom Engagement Rings I Made Recently!,"Sharing some custom engagement rings I just made for some of my clients! For all of my super custom designs (like the first 3), I share CAD computer renderings first so we can tweak the design as needed before sending it to be printed in a wax. Then, waxes are tried on with the stones in them.  I’ve been designing custom engagement rings for 10+ years now and enjoy all of the meticulous little details that make each design feel truly perfect! My clients come to me with a wide variety of style requests, so specializing in custom also allows me to design for everyone. I hope you love these as much as I do :) 

1st-2nd pic: Inspired by the organic movement of magma and water, this setting is made in solid 18k yellow gold and features a super special elongated, colorless Old Mine Cut diamond. The clamshell style partial bezel was made to appear softer in shape than the rectangular center stone, which rounds the overall design out nicely in my opinion. No 2 parts of this setting are the same! We went through 8 CADs and 2 wax prints before I felt this setting was 100% perfect

3rd-4th pic: My client’s request for this ring was to make it inspired by deco style while also ensuring it looks fabulous. My initial reaction was to work with an emerald cut, but she wanted a SUPER elongated center stone, so I swapped in a baguette cut diamond! I focused on a waterfall type effect with the accents and flanked center by 2 more complimentary baguette cut diamonds. It’s finished with little kite cut diamonds that lead into the band. Such a fun one! I probably shared 7-8 different layouts with varying diamond shapes and sizes during the design process. An example of the final layout on a gem case is in the 4th pic.

5th-6th pic: Inspo for this engagement ring came from my client's minimal, edgy and chic style. It features a colorless pear cut center stone with an extra elongated ratio set east/west in a partial bezel setting, made in solid 18k yellow gold. the setting features a knife edge around the band and tapers from a thicker to thinner mm width.

7th-8th pic: My client knew exactly what she wanted with this design! An ultra delicate bezel setting with an extra elongated, colorless emerald cut diamond center stone. Because of the size of the stone, I recommended a slightly thicker band in order to balance the stone size out (this is still thin imo). The diamond itself has an impeccable make, meaning that all grades on the cert aside, its beauty is what’s most notable- specifically how the facets catch light and almost sparkle. ",775,118,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcefu6

Hubs and I celebrated 6 years of marriage on Saturday and he got me a new ring that I never expected I wanted! 

 My original and much beloved wedding ring (slide one) sadly lost it's diamond and had to be forcibly retired. I've been so sad about it for a while, since this isn't the first time it fell out just the first time we couldn't find it. So on our anniversary morning I was just scrolling on Kay looking at rings we could afford and planning for the future. After going out for breakfast we decided to pop into our local Kay store to ""just look"" at what they had in store. Little did I know this wonderful man of mine had planned to walk out of the store with a new ring for me. We found this beautiful Marquise Amethyst  ring and I fell in love with it. (It's was also one I had loved online too). It is currently being resized to fit my finger but I can not WAIT to be able to wear this beauty! 

Sorry for the thesis, I'm just really excited and wanted to share with the world! Thanks for reading, and any tips on caring for an amethyst ring would be much appreciated ☺️🥰",29,3,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcl4c0

Combo post of me gushing over my ring but also curious to know if others have felt this way. 

The gush:
I can't stop staring and obsessing over my ring. I was proposed to this weekend and I'm truly floating on clouds. I knew I wanted a thicker band, a warm brownish stone, and a lowish profile. I was completely involved in in the stone selection and design process - zero regrets, the proposal was still a surprise (timing and how) and I ended up with my dream ring that feels perfect - sophisticated, bold yet classic. 

Huge thanks to this community 💕💕💕I obsessed over everyone's photos and it really helped me learn what I love and what I didn't love as I am not a jewelry person. 

The details:
1.52ct oval natural diamond 
Colour M 
Clarity VS-2, polish/symmetry Excellent/Very Good 
Ring size 6.5 (might resize to 6.25) 
Band 4mm, tapers to 3mm 

The question:
I love the ring so much on its own. I love the clean lines and simplicity - I feel like adding another ring would steal its spotlight. 

Has anyone else felt that way? 

I'm not too concerned about formal traditional. Do I just keep the one ring? Do I try and find a band that I may consider sometimes wearing with it? Or do I just get a wedding band I love and then have 2 options. Anyone else have this debate? 

I tried on a curved band with it (see last image). It's fine - but I miss the simplicity of the solo ring. 

Thanks all 💜

Overall, a very positive buying experience, and I am quite pleased with the final product: pics and video included so you can decide for yourself. 

For starters, here are the specs of the necklace and other details:

Diamonds: 

* Lab
* E-F/VS
* Round cut
* 2.2mm width (I purchased 2.2; my local jeweler confirmed they are closer to 2.5mm—hooray!)
* Unfortunately, I cannot confirm TCW, but I believe Dhruv estimated 2.2mm in 18-inch to be around 7 carats. 

Setting:

* 18 inch circumference
* 10k gold (I probably would have gone 14k looking back, but 10k is definitely viable and the stronger metal is a perk on a daintier necklace)
* Four-prong setting
* Double-security “butterfly” clasp

Shipping: 

* Time from payment to receipt: 1.5 months
   * this includes addressing my request to have it double checked for unevenness by their quality assurance team
* Shipping time (from India to US): 5-6 days
* Came securely packaged and there was no tarriff or import duty

Video from their team which gives a better idea: [https://streamable.com/a6kb9t](https://streamable.com/a6kb9t)

I will share I have been in the market for a tennis necklace for a long time. I shopped and shopped (and shopped), and finally heard of Ouros on this sub. I needed a necklace that was 18 inches, was cheaper than cheap, had a butterfly clasp because I’m paranoid about losing it, and from somewhere with a reputation for good customer service. Ouros checked all these boxes for me. FWIW, in my entire search I was unable to find any retailer as competitive as Ouros on price (maybe barring certain group buys or periodic promotions run by other retailers). 

I worked specifically with Dhruv, per my request because I had read several good things from others here. I, too, would highly recommend working with him. He sent a CAD for me to confirm prior to production, answered my *many* questions, was communicative on the status throughout, shared high quality videos of the finished necklace, and sent confirmation once the necklace shipped after I gave the go ahead. 

It’s definitely a budget necklace but it sparkles like heck, is comfortable to wear, does NOT flip, and the clasp is very secure—almost too secure as it’s not a piece of cake to take off. 

There was one minor hiccup in the process where signature delivery was missed, but they communicated with both myself and the shipper appropriately and Dhruv wound up making it right. I believe the way a business addresses issues speaks volumes and is highly determinative of whether I become a repeat customer. 

For anyone interested, here’s the link to the necklace and Dhruv’s contact information on WhatsApp. If anyone is wondering, no, I did not receive anything in exchange for this post. Information is power!

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 6 years, he is planning to propose sometime in the near future and has started asking me what I want.

I have attached photos of my Mom’s ring for reference. I think there are a lot of different things that can be done with the diamonds to be repurposed on a new ring. About 2 years ago I learned of Toi et Moi rings and have been in love with the idea of one.

As of right now, I want him to use my mom’s 1.5 carat Marquis diamond with a new diamond (not sure about which size or shape but leaning towards an emerald or another marquis) next to it. The thought of having my diamond and my mom’s together is beautiful to me. The other small baguette diamonds I would want to then use on my wedding band. 

I know next to nothing about rings and diamonds, but I told my boyfriend I would be happy with a lab-grown diamond. My mom’s is a natural so I don’t know if that makes any difference? 

Please share if you have repurposed old diamonds or have a Toi et moi ring. I would like to hear all the HONEST feedback and advice. What do you wish you knew before picking your ring? What should I know?

Extra detail:

I also have very small hands, to a point where people I just meet regularly point them out. The top of my middle finger to the bottom of my palm is about 6 inches, and I would say my palm across is about 2.5-3in.

I kept the necklace and it is now visibly stretched out after just six months of gentle wear. I’m currently waiting to hear back from customer service about a repair or replacement, but for a “fine jewelry” brand at this price point, the quality is very disappointing. 

I want to add that I own pieces from Aurate dating back to 2019 and 2020 that have held up extremely well. This is clearly a decline in quality. I would advise staying away if you’re looking for pieces that last, or at the very minimum match what’s advertised.

So now I’m unsure if NJ is just overpriced or if the diamond district just sells poor quality. Your thoughts would be much appreciated.

Ended up putting a deposit down with Complete Carat(also in the diamond district). Nick was awesome, had a great discussion of what exactly I wanted. He was real transparent of what comes with the different price points. Great price on the setting, even got a slightly bigger stone and better clarity.

Long story short, I visited two jewelers, one in the diamond district and the other one was a local one near me in Jersey. I got a quote from both jewelers for the same specs (color,cut,setting, etc.). The one from NJ priced it at $13,500, the one from the diamond district (Delicate Gem) quoted me at $3,600. So now I’m unsure if NJ is just overpriced or if the diamond district just sells poor quality. Your thoughts would be much appreciated.

It felt like a big, heartfelt decision at the time - but now, over a year later, I still feel a pit in my stomach every time I look at it. I’ve really tried to let it grow on me, but I just… hate it.

It’s a 1.5 carat pinkish-brown lab-grown diamond (very rare, my jeweler spent months sourcing it), with 28 natural champagne diamonds in a 14k rose gold setting. Beautiful, but it feels overwhelming on my hand. It’s just not me. The colors are just wrong and so are the proportions. 

We could have afforded a larger stone, but sourcing this particular color was so hard. I convinced myself the rarity made up for the size - but deep down, I knew I wanted something bigger and simpler. I tried to compensate by making the halo larger, and now it just feels like too much.

After also choosing the wrong wedding dress, I’ve realized I’m not a “snazzy girl.” I like clean lines, calming tones, and soft simplicity. At this point, I’d be thrilled with a minimal moissanite or morganite ring that actually feels like me.

But we spent $8,500 on this ring, and I’m trying to figure out what’s salvageable.

Has anyone ever gone back to the jeweler who made their ring for help?

1liia02,EngagementRings,mined diamond,1750689481.0,2025-06-23,2025,6,My 2nd diamond ring from Daniel William Diamonds [An Honest Review],"My husband and I just celebrated our first wedding anniversary last month. While I absolutely love the gorgeous ring that he gave me (a 4.51ct emerald cut solitaire on 14k white gold wide band), I think a second ring for everyday wear with a smaller diamond will serve me more efficient for my lifestyle. I do love wearing my e-ring with my wedding band daily, so having a second ring to alternate does make me feel better knowing that I won’t put much stress on just one ring. I believe that life is too short to keep wanting something and trying to put it on the schedule in this hectic life. We are blessed that our finance allows for our lifestyles, and thank God for giving us the good life.

It's worth noting that this is our second ring ordered from Daniel William Diamonds. Below is a detailed timeline, every single aspect that there is to know about the company, the keynotes, etc. My DM is open should anyone have any concerns. I believe in full transparency when it comes to creating such a special item that you’ll pretty much wear daily, and hopefully for the end of time.

To start off, I am a very picky person—especially when it comes to custom work. Sometimes, being a perfectionist does prevent me from enjoying everything to its fullest. This is because I can always see the imperfections and that I NEED to fix it, or I won’t be able to even look at it. I swear at times, it feels like a curse. With that being said, when I emailed Daniel William Diamonds the ring design, and it’s a whole detailed document about what I want: inspiring pictures, engraving letters, details down to the tea, etc. I’m talking like every mm to the thickness of the prongs, to a list of Dos and Don’ts, to every little thing someone needs to know when making my ring, you name it, it’s on the list of mine.

*[5/27/2025] First email sent regarding design, price agreement* (pics 2, 3, 4)

Because I do know a thing or two about picking my own diamond, so before emailing, I had done research to narrow down the one I wanted. I made sure to include the IGI#, and of course, DWD does in fact price match.

This is my first advice, do your own research, educate yourself about diamond so that you can choose the one you really want. And also, be realistic about the size, shape, color, clarity, and budget. What you see on other people might be the one you think you want, but in reality, choosing a ring that fits your lifestyle requires some consideration.

*Keynotes:
- They do price match.
- Custom works are a minimum of $2,500 (as of May 2025).
- I sent my payment the same day via PayPal (do let them know if you’d like to send payment via PayPal so they can prepare the link for you—prepare to provide your address).

*[5/28/2025] CAD received* (pic 5)

Within 24 hours, they emailed me the CAD for approval. I MADE sure to remind them my notes once again (this is me making sure that nothing had been potentially overlooked). I gave them the green light to move the project into production.

*Keynotes:
- They provided CAD within 24 hours after payment.
- They confirmed custom works take about 14 days (so I noted on my agenda to communicate with them to see if there’s any delay a day or 2 before “the 14 days guaranteed commitment”.

*[6/10/2025] First phone call to DWD for production update*

I called DWD at 2:35pm CST and Michael picked up. I asked him about my project, and he confirmed that my diamond would arrive and ready to be set and shipped out within the following week.

Note that this was around the time when LA downtown jewelry stores were robbed [link (https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/20-million-stolen-during-jewelry-store-heist-in-downtown-la/) to article], so I’d understand if the project were delayed (I mean I had to be realistic and sympathetic during this hard time). However, DWD came through and still committed to the plan they had promised me. This is super important in my book because they never for once asked for any extension.

*Keynotes:
- Always email/call/live chat to inquire about your project.
- Do not text any personal numbers because they are not allowed to communicate with clients on their numbers.

*[6/13/2025] DWD emailed confirming the diamond had been arrived* (pic 6)

*[6/17/2025] DWD emailed the ring’s pictures for approval before shipping the next day, to which I approved.* (pic 7, 8, 9)

*Keynotes:
- Only orders over $10k are shipped UPS Next Day Air.
- Orders under $10k (which is mine) will be shipped UPS via 2nd Day Air. [link (https://www.danielwilliamdiamonds.com/faq?srsltid=AfmBOor7itmIsgkZ7l3qOlRMcmIEaYMe9fNZm6raKkxO0VaJX71__99Y) to their policy]

*[6/18/2025] DWD emailed confirming the ring had been shipped with tracking number.* (pic 10)

*Keynotes:
- They will package and ship out orders by the end of day.
- IF YOU MUST CONFIRM ANY CHANGES OR CLARIFICATION, THIS IS THE ONLY TIME.
- All orders require an adult signature upon delivery.

*Final Words*

Creating and ordering an engagement ring for your partner or for yourself should not be intimidating. I should know firsthand the struggles, the confusions, the overwhelming feelings about pretty much everything, especially when there are so many of jewelry stores to choose from and tons of mixed reviews online.

As you have read through my post, you’ll understand how specific I am when it comes to my custom works—everything needs to be discussed and confirmed. While I cannot (ever) guarantee that your experience with Daniel William Diamonds will be as perfect as mine, I do appreciate and trust them for knowing what I need and delivering it. Of course, mistakes do happen once in a while, they are still human beings who try their best to make your vision come to life, hence, do allow some patience and sympathy. I promise they’ll have your back. I highly recommend them to those who are still on the fence about DWD.

As a good rule of thumb, DO read thoroughly their policy on the FAQs (https://www.danielwilliamdiamonds.com/faq?srsltid=AfmBOor7itmIsgkZ7l3qOlRMcmIEaYMe9fNZm6raKkxO0VaJX71__99Y) page; DO understand their return policy/shipping policy so when you face that route, you are well aware of it. I have read a few posts where people complain about other companies’ policy, but in full transparency, if we actually take our time to read, research, and ask all the questions before ordering, I promise shopping for an engagement ring online is not really that scary. In fact, it should be fun!

I cannot wait to work with Daniel William Diamonds again. I am thankful for them, for being my favorite jewelry store.",18,7,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1liia02

I’ve been with my boyfriend for three and a half years, we’ve been talking about getting engaged next year. I’ve always wanted an 1.5 carat oval shaped diamond with a half eternity band. 
A few weeks ago I was looking at some instagram stories and I saw an old mine elongated cushion cut engagement ring and I fell in love right away. I like elegant and classic engagement rings, which both of this shapes are.
I don’t know how to decide between the two. My boyfriend told me that he doesn’t have a preference and that he wants me to be happy, so when I have a decision, I should tell him. My friends are rooting for the oval shaped diamond and my sister is pro cushion shaped diamond.

Can someone tell me which is more timeless? Which one of them is more flattering?

I set out with a clear idea in my mind that I wanted an emerald cut diamond, and I was pretty set on a lab diamond for ethical reasons. 

But, looking at lab diamond prices on Calavera I’ve found that a decent stone in the size/style I’m looking for can be as low as $400, which feels a little anticlimactic for an expected budget of around $10k-$15k. I like the idea of opting for a stone with great clarity and cut over a much bigger carat size, but I don’t know if spending as much as $8-$10k (assuming the setting will cost $2k+) on a lab diamond makes sense. For folks who opted for labs and were able to get their desired stone for a fraction of the mined cost, did you just keep the savings (or put it towards something else entirely), or choose to upgrade the ring in other ways? 

To give an example, below are two stones that fit what I’m looking for, Stone A at $450 and Stone B at $9,669.

Stone A: (2.93ct, G, VVS2)

Today at a pawn store, I came across my dream ring. I loved everything about it. It had a halo with diamonds on the sides and on the basket. 14k white gold. The store was unable to give me information on color, clarity, or carat of the diamonds. No paperwork is included. They do have a tester and have stated that the diamonds are natural and not lab grown. My concern is that the center diamond appeared to have a yellow hue that was noticeable to the naked eye. The ring obviously had not been cleaned. Could this hue be caused by anything other than the diamond being low on the color scale? I would plan to have it graded, but obviously this would be post purchase. It also would need to be resized. 
What are some things I should be aware of? This would be my first major jewelry purchase. They told me that they have a diamond ""expert"" that comes in once a month and he could give me more information. I plan on talking to him and seeing if he is able to give me more information.

The idea right now is a very long/skinny marquise (lab grown- so near perfect in color/ clarity) on its own band and a second ring with the same band but a natural radiant diamond. Here is a very rough mock up. I found these two diamonds and can’t decide which overall look I’m leaning towards. what do you think looks better with such a spread-y marquise? Which of these two diamonds do you think is the “better”one overall? 

I have only seen the second diamond in person which is what I have on in the second picture- that is not the marquise we are going with, it’s too chunky for me but you can clearly see the color difference. I am loving the chunky radiant (bottom) but it being L color it looks much warmer compared to the marquise, but not necessarily intentional. Whereas the more traditional elongated cut radiant has a shade of yellow to it that looks clearly intentional and so warm and yummy. 

which direction would y’all go in?!

1lmgt43,Diamonds,natural vs lab,1751095179.0,2025-06-28,2025,6,Lab Grown vs Natural Diamonds - need your opinion,"Hi everyone, apologies if this has been discussed before. Back in 2016, my roommate wanted to buy a lab grown diamond - to be eco friendly which reflects his love for nature - he paid $7500 USD for the stone without a ring. Today we can buy 1 carat stones - similar / better than what he got for $200 USD. 

I understand as technology advances, costs can come down - however I’m scared it will go below a certain price that lab grown diamonds will be like buying a keychain. 

While natural diamonds have been around for longer, I’m confused which one to go for. I don’t particularly care that one has been around for longer than the other, I’ve made a small pros/cons below of each - please jump in where I may be wrong or other factors to consider?

Lab grown diamonds

Pros: affordability / visually the same

Cons: no value at all, maybe the gold band is worth more than the stone itself


Natural diamonds 

Pros: some value retention / heirloom for next generation

Cons: way more expensive / optically same as lab grown 


Correct me where I’m wrong as I’m new to this space and having difficulties processing it mentally, trying to decide what’s better for my to be wife. ",11,43,0.63,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamonds/comments/1lmgt43/lab_grown_vs_natural_diamonds_need_your_opinion/

Mine: this 5.41ct old cut diamond ring, auctioned today. Honestly, huge diamonds are not my thing, but I went to see this in person, and it was fantastic.

However, it only hammered for £10k: someone somewhere must be laughing. I don't know why I didn't bid further, but I regret not having bought this as old cuts of this size are really hard to come by, and to get it for this sort of price is almost unheard of at auction in the UK (a slightly smaller and arguably worse diamond hammered for £32k only 2 weeks ago). I've bought far less valuable pieces for a similar hammer price.

My husband recommended this company to me after he bought my ring from them 5 years ago (one that is truly amazing) and I figured it was a company I could trust. I purchased the [Sawyer ring](https://www.diamondere.com/p/mens-rings-sawyer-19214-18960) for my husband and did not think I'd have to wait **almost a month** to get it. I figured though since it was personalized, it would take some time and was fine with the wait.

  
When I finally received the ring while I was at work, , I was shocked when I saw a ring completely different than what I had ordered. It was all gold when I ordered the black design, the design wasn't even going in the right direction, and the diamond color itself was very faint when it was suppose to be peridot?? The thickness of the band was also noticeably thinner as well. 

I reached out to Diamondere and this was their lame response:

""*Hello, We are genuinely sorry for the oversight by the production team.* 

*The ring was crafted entirely in 10K Yellow Gold instead of the two-tone Yellow Gold and Black Gold as ordered by you.*

*Regarding the color of the Peridot, it is important to note that smaller colored gemstones naturally appear lighter than larger ones. Moreover, all small-sized color gemstones can never match the shade and darkness of larger colored gemstones.*

*As for the band width , all our jewelry is handcrafted, there may be slight variations between the product and the images.*

*Nevertheless, since we are committed to resolving this matter to your absolute satisfaction, we are happy to offer a full refund, exchange or remake, provided the jewelry is returned in its original condition with the tag and packaging intact.*

*In case you choose to get your jewelry exchanged, please share the design link of the jewelry you are interested in, and based on your updated preferences, we can either refund any balance amount or provide a link for additional payment, as necessary.*

My wonderful fiancé knows me too well and gave me free rein to pick my engagement ring, and this is what we decided on 🖤 it’s a 2.85c speckled black salt and pepper diamond in a rose cut (see second image) so it sits flush on the finger. 

My dilemma now is, what can I safely get for a wedding band? I love the look of the third image, but obviously this band is sitting under the main stone since it’s a high setting engagement ring, and mine is not. 

I know I can have the wedding band custom made to stack flush with the engagement ring, but I’m worried about the integrity of both rings for the future, since they will be basically rubbing against each other for life. 

What are your thoughts? Should I just not wear a wedding band with this ring to keep the diamond safe or is it really not that big a deal?

She described it as “each about 1ct, pear slightly larger for dimension.” She also shared a video of a bigger version she liked which looked like 2 x 1.5 ct stones. 

I have a private jeweler that’s quoted me the following lab grown - 1 ct round + 1.44 ct pear, both in G color. Round is VVS2, ideal cut, excellent polish and symmetry. Pear is VS1, excellent polish and symmetry. The quote I got for this combo with diamonds on half the band (platinum) is $4500.

Couple questions:
	•	Does this size combo sound good? Should the pear be bigger? Should they be the same size? I could afford to go a little bit bigger. 
	•	Is the quality/specs an okay value at this price point?
	•	Thoughts on doing diamonds on half the band vs going plain?

1loizkt,EngagementRings,mined diamond,1751316919.0,2025-06-30,2025,6,Insurance Questions,"Hi everyone - I have some questions regarding insurance for my ring. 

Can someone clue me in on appraisals? I was basically told if it is under $10k I do not need an appraisal but if it is over $10k I would need an appraisal, the report and a few other things. My question really comes down to it being a lab diamond that was purchased loose and set locally. The purchase price of the lab was MUCH lower than if we had purchased it at the same place we had it set. Their options were in the $6-9k range, while he got mine for much lower. If we had purchased the stone and setting from the them it would have been over $10k but doing it how he did it, it was around $5k for the whole thing. Do I get an appraisal done since they will probably make us buy the ring completed should anything happen? I believe insurance would base it off of retail value, which in this case would be much more expensive than he purchased it for. 

I know lab diamonds are much much cheaper than they previously were but even going into local jewelry store and big box stores they are still selling them for a pretty penny even if you can find the same stone online for 1/2 the price. I guess I’m more confused on the process of all of it. 


The insurance isn’t very expensive and there is a peace of mind knowing that we wouldn’t have to drop another $5k unexpectedly but on the other hand, is it worth going through the hassle of insuring it? I am super clumbsy (like really bad) so he is really wanting to insure it assuming the inevitable will happen lol. 

Thanks for any insight!

My 5-year wedding anniversary is next year. My husband and I have talked about upgrading my ring every 5 or so years, so I’m starting to think of what that might look like for next year. 

We bought the stone + setting from Shane Co, so they do dollar for dollar upgrades. My current stone is absolutely beautiful and my husband did a bang up job. 

Specs are (natural): 
- E color
- 0.94 carats
- VS2 clarity

I feel like we’re going to have to spend an arm and a leg to get an upgrade of comparable quality so I’m debating making a move to lab grown diamonds. I’d keep this ring and just purchase a new ring with a lab grown diamond. I absolutely do not want to sacrifice on color or clarity with a mined diamond in order to upgrade my current stone. 

Am I crazy for thinking my husband found one hell of a stone (y’all can tell me this is just average - I know I have emotional attachment to it lol)? And for balking at the price tag of a comparable stone at 2 carats? Is it worth it to just go buy a lab grown diamond so I can get the option for a bigger size at a fraction of the cost? I definitely have a mental block in my head of trading in this beautiful natural stone for lab grown so that’s not an option even though diamonds are NOT an investment. 

I upgraded my wedding band a couple of years ago, but it was out of “necessity”, so that’s also not an option. My original wedding band is a family heirloom (eternity band) and all diamonds needed to be retipped. It was more cost effective for us to get a new band than to retip the diamonds, but I’ll likely have them reset into a pendant at some point. 

I recognize this is a first world problem. The simple answer is that I could just not upgrade, but I can’t help want something a litttttle bit bigger 😅 the only other jewelry I regularly wear is a pair of diamond studs and diamond pendant that my mother gifted for my wedding day.

I’d like to upgrade my engagement band for my 10 year wedding anniversary. I’ve included photos of my stack. I currently have a natural diamond, brilliant cut, 0.92 center stone. I have been wanting to upgrade for some time but have some reluctance because I love my current set but would like a bigger diamond. I’ve been looking through Calavera and am leaning toward a 2.5-3 carat oval stone instead of a larger round diamond. I have tiny hands, lol. I’m honestly not sure what my ring size is as my bands fit right out of the case, nothing was sized. 

Has anyone had experience with reworking an existing band and liking the results? The stones in all 3 bands are natural, GIA certified, G color, VS2. I’ve been looking at lab stones in the VVS1-VVS2 range and E-F in color. 

I originally purchased my rings through a local jeweler and would plan to have them do the work. Ideally I’d remove the entire halo (circled in red in the 4th photo) and have a new head put in its place. The halo is only attached at the bottom, the sides that curl up to the halo are free floating against the halo. My bands and engagement ring are by Caro 74 and I’d like to keep the same engagement ring as everything fits so nicely together with the kiss stones on the side of each band and the squared off bands.

The ‘star’ diamond is a Festaria design, they are the only company in the world who can produce this unique cut with 14 artisans trained in this patented technique. These are exclusive to Japan and I feel very lucky to be the owner of one, and it feels so special to look at my ring and know there’s a little secret in there only I can see.     
The ring even comes with a loupe, so you can gaze upon the star whenever your heart desires. 

The diamonds are GIA graded, you’ll receive a lovely folder with the report inside. Mine is 0.22ct VS1 clarity, medium blue fluorescence, colour G. I love the size, any bigger and I think I would’ve worried about constantly banging/snagging it (I am… clumsy) 
I love the way it sparkles, especially with the 3 smaller diamonds either side. 

To order, my partner visited their store in Tokyo on our recent trip and had mine custom ordered to size because I needed a slightly larger size than what they had in stock (16). It took roughly 5 weeks for them to make. He had them ship it here to Osaka for collection, which he picked up on Tuesday from their Lucua1000 branch. Upon ordering, you’ll be in contact with a rep via WhatsApp the whole time and they will give you regular updates on the progress of the ring. They also come with a lifetime service guarantee and an additional mini ‘baby ring’ replica which you can wear on a necklace or give as a gift to a loved one.

Feel free to ask any questions if you have them 💕

If this isn’t the right sub to be posting in im sorry! hoping any advice on how to sell ghis piece of jewelry for the best **reasonable** price. I’m aware i will never get anywhere near what it was verbally appraised at !
I have zero experience selling anything, especially not something like this and I’m feeling really intimidated:(




Ive gotten 5 jewelers to take a look at it, measure and test it. and they’ve all agreed with its value/condition 


it is a solid 14K gold tennis bracelet with 36 natural round diamonds, each about 3mm in diameter (estimated GH color, SI1 clarity). All stones are secure in 4 prong settings with no chips or missing stones. The bracelet is 7ish long and weighs 11.713 grams. Verbal appraisal of around 20k. Understand that’s a retail or insurance value, not a resale figure.



my local consignment jewelers haven’t been great, a few have tried to pressure me a bit. I can’t blame bc it’s pretty clear  i’ve got no idea what I’m doing lol. 
I’ve looked into online sale like Diamond Banc, Worthy, etc.  either weren’t interested because large quantity/small individual carat pieces  and Worthy quoted me less than the gold scrap value, which sucks. I have never used ebay, i’ve only ever been a buyer on facebook marketplace.

Struggling to find the right wedding band for my vintage emerald cut, split shank, tourmaline engagement ring.","The first pic is my ring. The main stone is 2.6 ct tourmaline, side stones are .12 ct diamonds. I’m interested in diamond or moissanite (lab or natural), or similar clear colored stones for the band. 

Okay, so I have added a number of pics for reference of what I’ve tried on or seen online or here on reddit. At first I thought I wanted a very simple curved band. Pic 3 is the cheapie gold fill band I used at the elopement. Pic 2 is a solid gold ring I almost bought because they sat very flush and nice together. But as time went on, I began to get more interested in adding bling. The elopement ring was always a placeholder with intent to get the real ring for our big reception in the fall. 

I’ve considered a caged/enhancer band but they’re somewhat hard to find off the rack and I’m short on time for a custom ring. But it’s not impossible, just a little hard when I can’t try one on that fits the tapered shape of my setting to test it out (I generally hate online shopping). 

Pictures 4-6 are recently tried on. They all had the essence of what I’m looking for, but think I’d want to get a custom cage/enhancer to make the vision complete (especially love the daintiness of ring in pic 5). 

The last three are just photos from google searches and redditors with my same question. I don’t know if it would be comfortable with the two rings that don’t fit flush together. Has anyone here ever gone that route and regretted the feel/style of sets that aren’t matched/notched/soldered together? I’m personally loving the eternity or bezel bands, but feel like those would need a gap (partial style) because what’s the point of all the small stones if some are hidden under the main stone. 

Anywho, lots of thoughts here but what I would love is either recommendations for style, other’s experiences with pairing a split-shank ring with a band, and even jewelers you’d suggest for custom or off the shelf styles.

So I came across this subreddit about lab diamonds and how they are way more affordable than a natural diamond, but still a diamond nonetheless, so I said to him that I could accept a lab diamond (I love the marquise cut, but I do like other shapes) and first I would like to ask here first for advice on how to buy one or if it’s possible for us (we live in the Mexico, in the south side) to buy one from here in Mexico and to be delivered to our home (I’ve seen it’s better to have the diamond loose from calavera and then buy the setting from other jewelry) or if it’s best to go directly to the US and see it in person (a bit hard for us because I’m a doctor and he’s an engineer both of us working full time without space to vacations any time soon, but maybe we could find time to go if it’s better).

I would love some advice and tips about this. Thank you 🫶🏻

Diamond is a 3.03 carat oval (11.33 x 8.19) in D color and SI1 clarity. After looking at diamonds I decided that clarity is not the top priority for me. It's a lab diamond, as I am fascinated by the technology, support the ethical part of labs compared to naturals, and wanted a ROCK on my finger as a geologist (although diamond is a mineral not a rock...)

Ring setting is Cathedral Royale from Frank Darling on 4.25 hand with 2mm platinum! I loved the tulip basket design with cute side supports.

1lxmugw,labdiamond,natural diamond,1752279772.0,2025-07-12,2025,7,Luvansh Review – 3ct Oval Lab Diamond Ring (Photos + Real Thoughts from a Photographer!),"Hey friends! I wanted to share my experience with Luvansh since there aren’t a ton of reviews out there, and I know how nerve-wracking it can be to order something so big online.

My husband ordered my 3-carat oval lab diamond from them (🥹😭😭), and I’m honestly so impressed. The ring is absolutely stunning—well-made, crazy sparkly, and somehow even better in person than I imagined.

A few quick thoughts:
	•	✨ The diamond is VVS2, F color, and it dances in the light. Like, I catch myself staring at it when I’m supposed to be doing other things.
	•	⏳ It arrived a full week ahead of their quoted lead time! Major bonus.
	•	🔍 I’m a wedding photographer, so I used my macro lens to take some close-ups—sharing those below because I know photos are everything when you’re buying online (especially since the listing didn’t have many pics).
	•	💍 While there weren’t a lot of photos of this exact setting on the site, the final product is beautifully crafted and exactly what I’d hoped for.

We chose a lab diamond because we loved the ethical sourcing and the value. And honestly? It’s every bit as beautiful (if not more) than some of the natural stones I’ve seen over the years photographing weddings.

We picked the stone and added the setting, 18k yellow gold with a hidden halo!

Hope this helps someone else who’s debating whether to go with them! Feel free to ask questions—and enjoy the sparkle pics. :)",62,21,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lxmugw
1lxrv30,Diamonds,natural vs lab,1752295545.0,2025-07-12,2025,7,Can lab diamonds be Type Ia???,"Can anyone verify the statement in the screenshot with a credible source? 

If lab diamonds can be classified as a Type Ia, does that mean they’d pass for natural in like the Diamond Proof scanner that detects nitrogen in stones? I don’t understand how the machine works if a lab diamond can be type 1a chemically. It wouldn’t be 100% able to tell (as it claims) if it’s natural at that point if the machine is only detecting elemental makeup.

If they can actually make lab diamonds that are Type 1a, that means the only 100% accurate differentiating method is physical crystalline growth structure on the microscopic level. Am I right?

And somehow if they manage to mimic the growth structure then there may not be a point to owning natural diamonds anymore if their origin is totally unverifiable.

Finally, Tiffany only goes up to 0.4 ct for the stone. Give that we’re doing lab grown can go for something larger. Unless the setting makes larger stones unpractical .

1lye9uu,EngagementRings,natural vs lab,1752363070.0,2025-07-12,2025,7,I’m engaged! And confused about ring sizing!,"My fiancé proposed to me last Saturday with my dream ring! I’m so in love with it! It is a 1.98 ct brilliant round cut lab grown stone E color VS1 clarity, pavé band with round cut natural diamonds, all in white gold. 💕

I was initially sized at the jeweler for a 7.5 size ring, but that turned out to be  too large once I put on this ring. I went back to the same jewelry shop that initially sized me and made the ring, and they told me to resize it to 6.75. In the shop the 6.75 was a bit snug but could be taken on and off, and the jeweler said the size 7 was just a bit loose because the ring would spin. I thought the 7 may have been more comfortable, but I went with his recommendation and got it sized down to a 6.75. 

However, now I’m worried it’s too small. It goes on with a little pressure and wiggle, but I have to really twist and pull it to get it off over my knuckle. It’s not uncomfortable when it’s on my finger (I’m just aware of it because it’s new). If I gently twist it when it’s at the base of my finger, it spins. It leaves a slight indent in my finger when I take it off. If I take it on and off more than once in the span of a few minutes, it gets harder to get it on and off. I do not sleep in it, and have found it to be very hard to get on first thing in the morning. I’m afraid I made a mistake and had it made to small. Or it’s perfect by ring-fit standards? I’m also afraid that resizing it again could weaken the ring.

Has anyone experienced this? Has anyone advised to resize their ring to a 0.25 smaller size? And has anyone sized their ring down only to resize it up slightly again? I’m considering resizing it to a 7.

Any advice is appreciated! Picture of ring and mildly indented finger for reference 😊",32,23,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lye9uu

I'm pricing out a wedding band for myself (M). The ring is going to have 5 stones, princess cut, approx 3mm each.

The center is natural blue sapphire, accompanied by 2 topaz, and the last two is where I'm getting mixed info.

The one shop I'm in talks with says that the cost difference between lab diamond, moissanite, and white sapphire is negligible.

From what I've seen, lab diamond would still be significantly more.

Is this not the case?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I want to make sure I'm not getting talked into something that is more expensive under the guise of all stones being nearly identical in price.

I would be happy with moissanite or white sapphire if it meant I was saving hundreds.

I purchased my large, natural diamond in 2016. Without going into specific diamond details, my questions is simply whether or not y’all think natural diamonds will be more of a value in the future and have a bit more resale value than now, due to the heavy market for lab diamonds? 

Also, how to determine the difference between lab and natural diamonds under a microscope? I’m under the impressions that larger lab diamonds often have an “L” before the inscription of the certificate number, vs natural diamonds just have the full cert number. Is this correct?

I already know that when you buy a natural diamond, it shouldn’t be regarded as an investment because you are looking at resale value of often ~10% the second it is purchased. My question is whether that will go up or simply stay the same since lab diamonds of similar specs is already 10-20% of the cost of a natural diamond. 

Basically — just on opinion, will the resale value of natural diamonds increase or stay the same since everyone seems to be buying labs?

The ring was in a box with a bunch of other sterling silver rings and I tried it on and it fit perfect and made me laugh so I bought it for $20. What made me (and the salesgirl laugh) is that for being a fake ring, it really goes all out to appear real. I mean, it had a cathedral setting! In the age of big lab diamonds, it could “pass” to someone who doesn’t know jewelry. 


So my question is: has anyone seen anything like this before? I’ve tried searching the different travel ring sites but I can’t find anything similar. 


Details: the inside of the ring is marked W 925. The ring is plated and the plating (whatever it is) is wearing off somewhat. The stone has crisp facets and is a cushion cut.

I always wanted a sizable emerald cut diamond but I did not want my fiancé to have to pay $65,000 for one.

I contacted him &amp; I got really upset because the diamond dealer was saying that it wasn’t his fault and it would be $200 to fix it! 😡 I think the setting was used as a  placeholder to put stones in to show clients. See a close-up I took with my microscope of the notch in the channel. You can clearly see that there’s like a notch in the channel that holds the baguette in.
I own another ring with a shield-shaped garnet that is loose too but it can’t fall out, it can move a little bit. Should I just ignore this and enjoy the ring? Overall, the whole set up cost me about $2400.  But I feel pretty scammed by the NYC diamond dealer.

1m2kjk3,jewelry,mined diamond,1752789207.0,2025-07-17,2025,7,5K Platinum Ring Cracked Within a Month — Is Expecting a Replacement Band Unreasonable?,"I’m looking for some honest feedback because I’m feeling really frustrated and unsure if I’m being unreasonable here.

My husband and I recently bought a $5,000 platinum bridal set from Best Brilliance online to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and upgrade the modest set I originally started out with. This is the first and probably only time we will ever be able to splurge on a piece of jewlery like this. 

However within ONE month of normal, everyday wear, the engagement ring developed two cracks in the band, became visibly warped, and a side diamond fell out. I literally woke up to it like that on my finger.

I’m a stay-at-home mom — I don’t work with my hands in any strenuous way. I wasn’t lifting weights, doing construction, or slamming it into anything. Just basic day-to-day stuff: dishes, laundry, diaper changes, picking up around the house. Literally just everyday average wear. Even though fine jewelry like wedding rings, especially something you'd expect to wear daily, should be able to withstand normal use. Everyone uses their hands, even if they don’t work in a trade.

When I contacted the company we bought the ring from, I made it very clear that I only felt comfortable with a full replacement of the band otherwise I'd like a refund. Everything I’ve read — especially from jewelers and repair experts — says that when a platinum band cracks in multiple places, especially near the diamonds (where mine did), it’s almost always due to a structural failure in the casting, not user abuse. A solder or reinforcement repair can never fully restore the long-term integrity of the piece, and I'd be constantly worried it could fail again — next time possibly taking the center diamond with it.

They told me to send the ring in with a note stating my expectations so they could ""take care"" of it. But I never got a direct update on what was being done until after they sent it back, at which point I followed up for confirmation to know the extent of the repair done so I could feel confident wearing my ring again. Then I was told:

&gt; ""Your ring was not remade, but rather carefully repaired and reinforced to ensure both its integrity and longevity.""
""This type of damage is not typical under normal wear... we recommend mindful handling.""



That statement alone makes me even more upset. If it’s not typical damage, then shouldn’t that have been a sign to replace the band? To me, that’s confirmation something was wrong with the original casting. And instead of honoring my reasonable request, they downplayed the issue and implied I caused it  which just feels dismissive and gaslighting.

So am I expecting too much here? Is asking for a replacement band the standard or fair solution for this kind of early failure? Has anyone else dealt with this kind of situation?

I’m just looking for honest feedback from people who know jewelry, customer service, or have been through something similar. I really don’t think I’m being unreasonable — I just want a ring I can trust not to fall apart again.

I am now composing a reply email and trying to decide whether to escalate the issue to management and give them a second chance at a band replacement and resetting my stones, or just to return it at this point.

Thanks in advance.

Anyway, I would truly appreciate any feedback you may have on my CAD. I do intend this to be an heirloom piece, as it was inspired by my mother and my daughter. (It was actually designed by my husband and daughter together after my dad’s recent passing.)

1) I am already going to ask that the band width is increased to at least 1.8 mm.

2) I am good with high-set stones/big rings. (I’ve been a chonky ring-wearer for years!)

3) The stone is a 2.41 ct princess cut lab diamond in fancy vivid pink set in 10K white gold, and I’ve included a screenshot of the stone. My ring size is a 7.75 US. (I’ve got lots of swelling due to autoimmune arthritis. 🫠)

4) My daughter does have much smaller hands than I do (because genetics are weird), so there will be a significant resizing in 40 years or so.

I am currently in the stages of designing my engagement ring and am starting with a 2.82 carat old mine cut, L color diamond. It is such a stunning stone and slightly elongated, with a ratio of 1.13.  

Most of my everyday jewelry leans on the large, bold, and chunky side. I even wear a men’s watch and want my ring to feel proportionate to my other pieces, which is why I’m leaning towards a trilogy over a solitaire. 

I’m currently thinking three old mine cuts, with the sides stones in the 0.6-0.9 ct range. Or potentially step cut trapezoids. Does anybody have examples of either that they can share?  ",1,3,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngagementRings/comments/1m5554t/old_mine_cut_3_stone_ring_examples/

He thinks it’s not the same it’s not real it doesn’t hold value and it’s just not what he wants me to have and pass down to our daughter or son. 
 I get what he’s saying but I don’t mind if it’s lab or natural. I think they are very similar equally as beautiful and it’s still a diamond. This prices are obviously a lot better is a big one for me too. I just don’t want to zoned to much right now especially since we are doing a lot of things to our home like upgrades and furniture room by room. Stating with the kids room la and that cost money. I would even say let’s do this right now and get a natural later and upgrade. 
Also what do you all think about this one. It’s IGI certified Pink 3ct.. Emerald cut for $1900. It’s stunning I love it. 

TL;DR (didi I do that right) 
What do you all think about natural vs lab grown? Fiancé doesn’t want a lab for more says it’s not real but I don’t mind either, they are just not made the same way. Do you all think they are the same, will hold or still have value in the future to be passed down and quality. ",0,4,0.5,https://www.etsy.com/listing/1845922852/?ref=share_ios_native_control

We have been working with Ben Bridge to find a ring, but they are a little slow and have a limited selection in-person, so we wanted to just see what KAY had to offer.

We are okay with big box stores since we move around a lot, so it’s nice to have a location nearby to get things cleaned or resized. We just wanted a special, simple, and VERY sparkly engagement ring.

Initially, the KAY salespeople ignored us as they were making a sale to another couple. And then…they all descended on us at once. 

We tried 5+ settings and 5+ different diamonds in less than half an hour, and I know I’m an indecisive person, but they kept asking “is this the one? Is this the one?”

They DID have a beautiful 2.04CT E VS1 radiant that made me fall in love with lab-grown, for $2700 on sale. Fine.

I also fell in love with a wedding band that was $2000. Overpriced, but fine.

However, what I didn’t realize is that the fairly basic setting they tossed at me was $4000 DOLLARS. I’ve linked it below, it’s 0.5CT total natural diamonds and basic as hell…not even a hidden halo, which is something I’ve been wanting.

Because it was a limited time sale, and we felt pressured, and I didn’t hate it, they gave us all of it plus the protection plan for $10K, and my boyfriend bought it.

I wished we could have at least checked out more settings for this diamond, and not felt so rushed. I also just had such a stressful experience that I don’t want that to be associated with the ring forever. But I also feel like I’m way overthinking.

What should I do? Return it all and keep going with Ben Bridge? Ask to go in and get a different setting? I know by going with a big box store I’ll be paying retail prices, but how bad did I get scammed?",13,29,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m7inuy

I'm currently in the buying phase of engagement ring hunting, I've got an idea of what I want the ring to look like, and a CAD image I had a local shop create for me - its not exactly what I was looking for but its pretty close. I'm in Canada, and had a pretty good feeling about Brilliant Earth, till I came here, and then hit Brilliance, but I'm not sure if their prices are in CAD or USD. The picture of the ring is what I got done locally, I still might go with them given that its not their final design - I didn't want the little diamonds in the design, and that could be the reason its a bit pricer than I imagined at first - 3600 rather than the 2600 I had anticipated. 

  
Does anyone know if Brilliance is priced in CAD - I don't see a converter so I've got to assume its USD but if anyone knows for sure I'd appreciate it.

  
Also any other recommendations for a site that has designs like mine, or any vendors that you trust would be appreciated.

You know what is precious and rare, Al? Meeting a human out of billions who turns out to be your person, forever. Your soulmate. Maybe becoming the parent to your children. The person who stands beside you in sickness and health. 

You know what else is precious and rare these days, Al?? Finding the funds to buy a house for couples to grow their families in, however that looks to them. 

Labs make up TWENTY FIVE PERCENT of the industry from 1 percent a few years ago. To that I say, ""thank goodness for that!""

I reeeaaally hate to break it to you, Al, but kids today are so much smarter. They can see through the manipulative advertisements and they resent it because it assumes they are stupid, blind consumers.

When we first brought them in, some designs felt a little too bold or heavy, so we made small adjustments — slimming the bands, resizing the stones, and making them more wearable for everyday use.



Curious — which of these styles would you actually wear day-to-day? Do you lean toward simple, minimalist jewelry or something with more sparkle?",2,14,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m8mflj

Anyway- I just got engaged two weeks ago, and I love my ring. 10k white gold with an oval cut aquamarine center stone, diamonds flanking each side. However, I’m looking to swap out the aquamarine since it’s a softer stone and I’m definitely not easy on my hands.

I found a pink lab sapphire stone that I adore. It’s a 6x8mm oval in a firework cut. However, it’s from an Etsy seller which I know can be hit or miss, but one person on here did get a ring from this seller and said their jeweler confirmed it is a real sapphire. The seller told me he’d price the stone at $80.

I’m having a hard time finding loose lab sapphires to compare this price to from a site I’d trust is legit (I’m seeing mostly just Etsy stuff). Mined sapphires that size are easily over $1000. Is a lab sapphire really that much cheaper? Or does it sound like $80 for a 6x8 lab stone is still “too good to be true”?

I mean, I’m not too sad being out $80 if it turns out to not be real, so it’s not a huge gamble. But I don’t want to set my heart on something just to get disappointed.

I appreciate any input!

   ** I only want lab grown, no natural stones** 

I had pictured myself having an emerald gemstone for the longest. I like that it was a gemstone that people didn’t typically pick for their ring, the hardness was slightly less than a diamond but, still comparable, it’s my boyfriend’s birthstone and overall would pop against my skin tone. But, I’m really into the bezel/triple baguette style that only seems to cater to diamonds as opposed to gemstones. Now that I’m heavily leaning into the triple baguette/bezel style, i feel my head turning for diamonds because at the end of the day, they’re undeniably eye catching. I’m not opposed to getting something custom made but, would like to avoid that route to save money.

* Option 1 is a CVD-grown diamond, while Options 2 and 4 are HPHT. Does the growth method (CVD vs. HPHT) matter significantly, as CVD seems to be cheaper in our options (and 'rarer' to find, since I've read that HPHT gives better control)

* Option 2 has a depth of 69.1%. Seems high for an emerald cut diamond?

1mbh7jp,EngagementRings,natural vs lab,1753711791.0,2025-07-28,2025,7,How long did it take you to find your ring and when did you start looking?,"When it comes to decision making, I'm the most ""thorough"" person I know. Whether I'm picking a piece of furniture, a computer, a home, a car...whatever it is, I do my research. Sometimes I wish I could just walk into a store and pick the first thing I see and be done with it. But that's just never been me. And the thing is, I actually enjoy doing the research, and feeling the satisfaction when I find the right thing.

So when my boyfriend and I started talking about marriage recently, I quickly realized that I know absolutely nothing about rings (or jewelry in general).  And that I probably should have started learning a long time ago. We went to a jewelry store (it was a surprise, otherwise I would have done some research beforehand), and I was completely overwhelmed with all the shapes, sizes, colors, clarity, natural vs lab etc. I had no idea what I wanted or where to start. And the store we went to, the woman was very nice. BUT I did get the vibe that she expected me to have some idea of what I wanted already, based on the questions she was asking. I would have wanted to try on a bunch of different shapes of diamonds to get an idea of what looks good on my hand, but she seemed to want me to pick a shape at the beginning and then we go from there with narrowing in on stone size and settings etc. And again, because this whole jewelry store visit was a surprise, I wasn't prepared. If I had known about it beforehand, I would have gone into the store with a game plan.

This is the first relationship I've ever been in that's gotten to the point of marriage even being discussed. So it's really not something I ever thought about at all in any past relationships. I'm also not a jewelry person in general, so jewelry is not something I would have already been up to speed on. My boyfriend is extremely patient, but we're also different when it comes to making decisions. I think he would have been happy if I had left the store that day with a ring or a decision about a ring. So I don't want to drag the process out, but I feel like I need to do some research. I didn't fall in love with any of the rings I tried on at the one store.  I don't want my boyfriend to think I'm stalling or anything. How much time is too long?

  
So my questions are, 1) how many weeks/months did it take you to find your engagement ring? 2) Did you only start looking after you started talking about marriage or before? I almost wish I had started looking way before the topic came up, so I would already know what I want by now. 3) How many stores did you visit?

I'm finalizing the design for my soon-to-be fiancé's engagement ring and could use some perspective.

**The stones:** Two beautiful natural 2ct stones (pear and oval) of superb quality from a family contact in Scotland.

**The dilemma:** I've had two of her favorite designers create concepts:

* Image 1: A more modern design in the signature style of a designer she wears frequently
* Image 2: An extremely classic and timeless option

**My concern:** While I know she'd love both, I'm wondering if the modern design might feel dated down the road. She works in fashion and is very trend-aware, but has consistently worn pieces from both designers throughout our relationship.

Looking for thoughts on timeless vs. personal style when it comes to engagement rings!

I am latino and don't know much about more western wedding traditions (I live in Canada now) and there are so many things I don't know! Tbh I didn't know engagement rings are not the same as wedding rings (at least here lol). 
I always wanted that if I got engaged that my partner would choose my ring, something that reminds him of me with a touch of his own. I might have said at some point that I wanted it to be flower theme if possible!
This is the ring he got me and I am so in love with it! I like that it is unique and not too big because I am not used to wearing rings and I prefer smaller accessories. I was so excited when he proposed I didn't even look at rhe ring for like an hour afterwards because it was cold and he told me to put on gloves after he gave it to me and I didn't takw it off until qe were back at the hotel lol. I am not a green fan so it surprised me that he chose emmeralds! I asked him what made him think of that and he told me the green is because it is supposed to look like leaves and in the future he wants to put some purple stones to make it resemble more a flower 😭 It is perfect and he deisgned it himself and I am so touched of how much he thought anout it. It is also a lab diamond 💜 (which I prefer and also I am a lab technician so it fits too lol)
He also got me a second ring (last picture) that is on the cheaper aide because he said that is my every day eing and the 'one' is for special ocasdions on when we are together because honestly I am terrible with things and I lose everything lol and I love the second one too! I'm very happy 💜

An Ourous review.,"This is my first lab diamond piece and first time having a custom piece made so I was quite nervous about the process. I chose Ourous because of the positive reviews on the sub and because of their fast response time when I asked around for quotes. 

I worked with Krishty who was very helpful, patient, and responsive. She took her time to answer all my questions before we even discussed pricing. I had a custom diamond cut (see below) with IGI cert and the setting made in 14k gold. The final price was $4800 (including $30 shipping). I paid on 6/20 and got the ring 7/28. The price is a bit higher than I would have preferred but I’m ok with the amount based on the excellent customer service and because the stone had to be custom cut.

I’ll start with saying when we went ring shopping I wanted a 2-3 carat solitaire lab diamond, the cost didn’t matter to me and I wanted something simple but striking. 

However 6 months ago my grandmother reached out to my finance about gifting me the center stone to her diamond as she was getting an upgrade. She has a stunning natural diamond and her and my grandfather are extremely important to me so he took her up on the offer. 

I absolutely love my ring and sentimental value but I wanted a solitaire setting since I wanted a bigger stone but now that my stone is one carat I think I’d like some kind of ring enhancer to add to it. I’d really love the option to wear it as is and with the enhancer so I don’t want to do anything permanent and I honestly change my mind a lot so I want to be able to stack different rings with it. 

I’ve been looking on etsy and haven’t found something quite what i’m looking for so I thought i’d take to reddit! I’ve got a few pictures of things I really like and have found links to but would love something that doesn’t overtake my ring, and sits as if it was apart of it already!

I brought my engagement ring to a local jeweler (not a chain) this weekend because I could hear the stone rattling in the prongs and could actually twist it a little inside them. It’s a bigger stone set pretty high so one of the times I’ve bumped it must have gotten it good enough to make a big difference. They asked for the day to fix it and for my husband and I to come back the next day to grab it. 

Went to pick the ring up and noticed that and the whole diamond is lop-sided badly, one of the prongs is not aligned with the rest, and I’m genuinely nervous to wear it because I’m worried the metal is compromised…not to mention I can still hear the diamond rattling like an expensive little maraca if I shake it. 

When I voiced this to the attendant (maybe the jeweler? She kept saying “the jeweler did x” so I’m not sure?) at pickup, she said they did the best they could because the prongs weren’t the same length to begin with, and that whoever made the ring shouldn’t have put that big of a stone in those prongs. She said they could put some reinforcement in “the next time I come to get it tightened” but I really…

1) Don’t want to keep having to get the prongs tightened? Never heard of this being a regular thing?
2) Don’t want to trust them with that work if this is the first product I get back.
3) The prongs weren’t perfectly aligned and the stone wasn’t lip-sized when he proposed, so they clearly can be straight?

It looks really wrong, but I’m obviously not a jeweler so I don’t know if what she said holds any water. Any experienced people can tell me if this is actually as bad as it looks? ",30,31,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcwtbd
1mcz7wx,jewelry,mined diamond,1753856804.0,2025-07-30,2025,7,Help with career change!,"Hi everyone! 

Hoping for a bit of advice from people with more experience than me.

So, for as long as I can remember I've always had a passion for gemstones and jewellery. We moved to the UAE nearly two years ago and my previous pharmaceutical sales career is simply no use to me here. With the job market the way it is here and my personal job prospects I think it's time to focus on my passion and start my own bespoke jewellery design business. I already have contacts with a reputable workshop here who want to collaborate with me. I've made a number of pieces with them now.

I would like to do a course in CAD jewellery design, coloured stones and polished diamonds. I know I probably don't ""need"" to do all three but I would love to do them anyway as it's always been a dream of mine. It would also give me a strong foundation into the business and provide business networking opportunities, which in turn would boost my confidence. I want to bring a high level of value and expertise to my customers. Something I certainly lacked when I was going through the design process of my engagement ring here in Abu Dhabi.

So, IGI provides all three courses in Dubai, I'll link the courses they do here https://www.igi.org/course-schedules/

The CAD programme covered in the IGI course is called CrossGems which according to ChatGPT ""CrossGems is a 3D CAD software plugin developed for Rhino (Rhinoceros 3D), specifically designed for jewelry design. It’s similar to MatrixGold and RhinoGold but is a lighter, more affordable, and modern alternative.""

I was considering doing a 3D Jewellery Design at a private institute in Dubai called Dubai Design Academy, they use the MatrixGold software, but the price would be similar but I'm not overly convinced that this course would be any good.

I suppose my question is, does anyone have any advice on whether it sounds like a smart move?

Is CrossGems worth learning on, or should I focus on something like Matrix. The workshop I'll be working with have CAD experts, but I'd like to be able to do the basics, know whats possible with the softwarw and possible make small edits myself (to start off with at least).

Has anyone also got any experience doing these courses with IGI? There's lots of conflicting info out their between which organisation is better, IGI, GIA, AIGS etc, but the IGI school is just an hour from where I live, so it makes it alot more feasible for me.

Any advice welcome because I'm flying completely blind with this!",4,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/1mcz7wx/help_with_career_change/

People have said it’s sitting too high, while others have said those that sit flush with the halo don’t allow as much light? Would they do that or is it better to return and ask for a custom setting?

I bought her engagement ring from Jeweler A. We went to a different jeweler (Jeweler B) together to buy our wedding bands.

This was about 4 months before the wedding.

We ended up getting a great wedding band for my wife from Jeweler B, but that’s beside the point.

Jeweler B insisted that it would be a good idea for us to leave the engagement ring that we got from Jeweler A with Jeweler B for the 4 months until the wedding. He said something about keeping the ring safe and they would clean it blah blah blah. He was uncomfortably persistent on this idea.

I was so confused by this that I kept pressing on why they wanted to do this and never got a very satisfactory answer. Ultimately I had to firmly say we aren’t leaving the ring with you. It was awkward. My wife said “I want to wear the ring while I’m engaged not have it sitting at a jeweler….”

A year later this continues to baffle me. It still seems to me that the most likely reason for this is that the jeweler was up to no good. I can’t shake this thought that they wanted to replace the natural stone with lab grown and hope we didn’t notice. 

Is there a legitimate reason for offering to hold onto the engagement ring (from another jeweler) for several months? Am I totally off the mark or was my intuition directionally correct that this guy was up to no good.",156,45,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/1me0nql/jeweler_wants_to_hold_onto_engagement_ring_for/

The diamond I wanted, a 2ct round brilliant set in platinum, would have cost $10K+ back then. I wanted a blue diamond, but that was never going to happen unless I didn’t mind getting a chip size that would require a jewelry lope to see.

I happened to see a today’s special deal on one of the tv shopping channels, for a 2ct equivalent Moissanite in 14k white gold, that also allowed monthly payments. It was very pretty and fit our budget, so that became my engagement ring.

Over the years I’ve always thought of having a real diamond engagement ring, but something would always happen where we couldn’t afford it.

Then I found these lab diamond subs on Reddit. To be perfectly honest, I really thought these were elaborate scams at first. I couldn’t believe that people were talking to businesses via WhatsApp and ordering diamonds and diamond jewelry from China, India, and other countries. It absolutely boggled my mind.

After watching and reading for a couple years, I realized that these are real people and they are getting their jewelry directly from manufacturers in other countries. It was amazing.

I kept watching, reading, and learning about diamonds, all the while trying to decide what exactly I wanted for a ring. I have seen, and saved, so many ring posts, that it’s ridiculous.

A couple months ago, my husband casually shows me a photo of a ring that is ridiculously expensive, and asks if I like it. I immediately replied that if you’re thinking of buying me a diamond, please don’t. I prefer to source the stone and setting myself.

I spoke to Lynn, at LGG, about a ring I had seen on their page. It was exactly what I would have picked back in 2006 if we had the money. And no matter that I’ve seen so many gorgeous rings over the past few years, when it came down to it, it was still my favorite.

Lynn has been phenomenal throughout the process, especially when we realized that I have no idea what I’m looking at on a CAD drawing. She was very understanding and sent my ring back to production to make it look the way I wanted.

I could not be more pleased with the whole process. Lynn and LGG are phenomenal! My dream ring is absolutely beautiful and I’m so happy with it. 😁💍

2. connected with their representative - Cait. told her the exact item, size, metal - cost and price match - I've  listed it all out for them.
3. Cait told me she is connecting to hold on the diamond.
4. 2 days passed, no replies.
5. I contacted rare carat and guess what, another representative came to tell me that the price increased by 300 due to tariffs.

WTF.

No mention from Cait, had to hear this bloodly news from another person. Price goes up and down but come on, just tell us if there is a change and let us know instead of keeping quiet.

Now I have to redo the whole process again.

Has this happened to anyone before?

**Update:** I had to find a new diamond to price match which went through and they kept their price for the setting offer. They called us to check the delivery location ( they don't prefer PO box but did an exception for us) . They called and left voice mail to inform us on the process. And we got notification that it is delivered and will be collecting it tomorrow! Fingers crossed!

Another thing I noticed, the same ring setting was priced differently when I go to different browsers - so double check and screengrab before you make the payment. Same goes to your price match diamond prices!

**Update update:** I got the ring! It's beautiful, the ring box is a bit too big and not that pretty (my own opinion) this is what is included in the box:

1) Your ring in the box

2) a pouch with ring sizers (very handy and all metal - very well made)

3) A polish cloth

4) your certificate of your diamond and also how much your ring is evaluated incase you wish to insure it. 

  
Note - you have 1 year period to get 1 free resizing. After that period it depends of the ring size change, it is going to cost you. Also any additional changes will cost you - a lot. 

  
Other than the glitch with Cait - rest of the people in Rare Carat has been helpful and very patient. So I am glad and will vouch for anyone to get their rings from them.

**1) Go for the bigger carat size.** No one can see the colour difference (E vs G) or clarity (vvs1 vs excellent) or minor imperfections (you really can't see the imperfections when it is so blinding in the light). Have some imperfections in the gem - save that money and get a bigger gem and your will be happy that it is bigger. I know I am &lt;3

**2) Check the size of the gem (esp if it is not round)** \- a 2 carat oval diamond can be (Length 1.5mm x Width 2mm x Height 3mm) vs another 2 carat diamond is measured at  (Length 1.3mm x Width 2.5mm x Height 2 mm) and it is still a 2 carat diamond. Carat is by weight and not by size - so create a table of your ideal diamond and their size to the ring design / setting that you have in mind. 

**3) Pick the settings first - then pick the diamond.** It is all going to be very overwhelming - the more choices you have, the more headache and analysis paralysis- I would suggest to go to Aliexpress and see if you can find your 'dream' ring design for cheap - get several different designs of that - it will also give you an idea of your ring size and they also act as your holiday ring. You will then know if it the carat is ideal or if your like the design. 

**4) Don't get stuck / sucked in with one company's branding and social media**\- I was heavily sucked into Cullen jewelry, Kayge\_studio, cadette Jewelery, Sofiakaman - their insta social media is top notch and I was mentally convinced I want to get their ring. But as I did more research - I found out that I am paying for their design / setting and the diamond is honestly a high markup. Rare carat came up and they also do lab diamond price match which is a bonus for me - I'm not sure if those boutiques listed above does price match (if they do, let us know - it's good business for them and for the customer too!) 

Note - we picked the setting and diamond together as a couple - we are already engaged - and so we want to pick this together. 

If you are planning to surprise - you don't have to get the ideal ring the first go - Rare Carat and many other companies has good return policy (do double check) and you can figure out a good ring together later. 

  
All the best to find your ideal ring! ",7,21,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngagementRings/comments/1mejh3e/unsatisfied_rare_carat_experience/

I've been wanting to upgrade or re-do my wedding set for YEARS. I tried adding ruby bands, combining my original set into one...it still wasn't quite what I wanted. So this year, I finally found a jeweler to work with that could help make what I've had in mind. The main things I wanted were: princess cut, kite set, bezel, and rubies (my birthstone). While looking at designs, I felt really drawn to tension/bypass settings, so that's what I settled on.

The original set was a 0.3 ct genuine princess diamond solitaire in 18k white gold, with a channel-set wedding band. It was...fine, but didn't excite me I guess? Back then, I picked out what I felt like I *should* have and didn't really look at anything else. So, they were able to use the gold from that set to make this one, which I thought was really awesome and makes it really feel like just a gussied-up version of my original. The new stone is quite a bit bigger though which will take some getting used to: 0.83 ct lab diamond, F color, I think VVS2? There are 14 natural rubies on it as well. The first pass of the design had them more in the center, but I asked to have the flair thingies a bit wider and he moved the rubies to the edge. That little tweak really did it for me.

I don't plan on getting a separate band, I just wanted one ring that had it all, and I feel like they really delivered. There are some very slight imperfections in the bezel, but only if you look *really* closely. The jeweler is very cool though and said if I wanted to tweak anything, to bring it back and they'll take care of it. I'm hesitant to mess with the bezel though because I don't want to do more harm than good. Bezels seem kinda finicky to work with (reading other posts) and I love it as-is.

Again, I know it's not everyone's style and that's totally okay, but I really feel like this suits me and it's amazing to finally have my vision come to life! (Btw, hubby was totally fine with all of this, he said if I'm happy, he's happy. ❤️)

Pics 1-3 are new ring (sorry for crappy quality), 4 is original set, 5 is original with an extra band with rubies, 6 is when I smushed the solitaire and band into one ring, and 7 is the smush plus a different ruby band. Definitely happier with the new one!",13,9,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1memuic

1mgc2yc,jewelry,natural vs lab,1754201777.0,2025-08-03,2025,8,Why are red rings so hard to find?,"Is there a reason red rings are so difficult to find? NO matter how hard I hyperfixate, minimal ring red ring bands don't seem to exist. Blue, purple, pink, black-- absolutely. But, not red. I'm wondering if there is some jeweler reason behind that. Is red particularly difficult to work with? Does it fade too quickly? It is so difficult to find that one, and there has to be a reason. 

I'm looking for a minimalist red ring band. 1 mm, preferably, something I can wear daily. I hyperfixate on this every few months. Here's what I've found so far: 

Tons of silicone ring bands, but I'd really like some kind of ""metal."" 

There are two rings on Etsy that are pretty, but aren't intended for daily wear. 

There are some on Aliexpress, most sold with a disclaimer that the ring might contain lead or cadmium. The only one I've found without that disclaimer started chipping immediately. 

There are some very thick red ring bands, usually tungsten, but I'm looking for something thin. 

Rings made of resin, or natural stone/crystals. These tend to be thicker, and that wouldn't be compatible with my sensory issues.  

**The photo is ""Arctic Symphony | red | inner ring"" by Bering.** I don't believe it's meant to be worn on its own, and it isn't sold in my size(6 or 4). I've considered buying it and getting it sized, but I'm concerned the edges of the ring would become irritating to my skin. They do have it in a 6, but in a 2mm style that is also not a comfort band. 

Also tons of string-rings, bead rings, acrylic. I've tried to make wire-wrap rings with red wire. But, ultimately, I cannot find what I'm looking for. Given the whole, ""Red string of fate"" thing, I'm totally confused why this isn't a more common ring. I figure, if it's so difficult to come by, there has to be a reason. Maybe, if I know the reason, I'll have better luck finding what I'm looking for. Ultimately, I want a 1 mm red ring band in a size 4 or 6 (ring finger vs. middle, pointer, or thumb). Ultimately wishlist would be a red knot style ring, which is what I tried to make. Apparently, I'm not naturally gifted at jewelry making. If anyone has any insight or suggestions, I'd be to grateful. And, I will try to respond, but I do have very bad ADHD so I apologize in advance if I don't.

Engagement ring: Looks almost exactly like the picture; Main stone (3 ct pear cut diamond, VS1, colour G, excellent cut); the marquise diamonds go half way around the band, 14k yellow gold

His wedding ring: 14k yellow gold + white gold dual tone thick band; designed with very fine lines curving in different directions which is executed masterfully all around the band 

My wedding ring: under 2mm of 14k yellow gold band made to sit flush with my engagement ring (almost like a gold border highlighting the ring); the design on the ring is supposed to mimic the design on my bf’s ring as much as possible.

We want to go with them mainly because my bf fell in love with his ring and we haven’t found anywhere else that even comes close to how beautiful it is. However, since this is our first time ring shopping, we wanted to make sure we were paying a fair price for the rings.

I found a diamond on Ruby Harper, but without having ordered from there and having ordered from LGD a couple of times previously, I decided to stick with them. So I reached out, asked about their price match, they quickly provided the link - so far so good. A couple of days after I have paid, I received an email that had the same information twice (looked like a clumsy copy and paste), with someone else’s diamond and mine, both allegedly being sold out. 
The only option I was provided in the email was to “look through their inventory”. 
After some looking, I replied both over the email and chat that if they could price match another diamond, I’ll buy that one, but otherwise would want my money back. They ensured me via chat that it would be possible. 
Now the second diamond is gone, they couldn’t answer via chat (and no response via email), and I can’t get my money back. Has anyone had a similar experience? How did you resolve it? I know there’s always chargeback, but that’s usually a nuclear option for me.

Feel free to ask our lab anything!","Hi /r/jewelry folks! It’s Arya, from over on /r/syntheticgemstones and the various related subs. You might have seen my posts about gemological research and the causes of colour in gems. Well, my gemological research lab has basically studied everything we can in sapphire, so we're launching a Kickstarter to upgrade our equipment to allow us to grow our own novel, exotic lab sapphires, which we're cutting into gems to help fund the lab. 

Since we’ve gotten tons of questions about the different types of lab-grown sapphire, I’ve coordinated with the /r/jewelry mods to do an in-depth educational post about lab sapphire, along with some mild Kickstarter plugging at the bottom. (Photos used with explicit permission from their owners.) Thanks mods :D

Natural sapphires and lab sapphires are **functionally equivalent** with regard to use in jewellery. (Minor differences to be explained below). They’re both made of Al2O3 (corundum), with the same crystal structure, same hardness, same optical properties, etc. They’re both coloured by the same impurities in the same way. Blue sapphires, fancy sapphires, rubies, padparadscha, and geuda are all the same exact gemstone, just with different colours. But their different growth environments and inclusions mean different things in terms of the crystals’ end appearances.

Sapphires and rubies grown by the [flame-fusion method](https://tomsboxofrocks.com/cdn/shop/files/il_fullxfull.3173661946_szk9_2ce0ca97-907a-485a-84f5-60440c9ecad2.jpg?v=1716430525&amp;width=713) ( also called the “Verneuil” method) are made by pouring sapphire powder and colouring agents through a specialized oxygen+hydrogen flame. The powder melts and then recrystallizes, forming a cylindrical “boule” that is [split in half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WvP5OxdxGE) to relieve strain. It’s the least expensive to produce and has a wide range of colours, standardized using 2-digit “Verneuil codes”; different colouring agents and different amounts of oxygen vs hydrogen are what allow the different growth colours. Sapphires grown by this method have colour zoning, in this case an [inner “core” of one colour and an outer “rind” of another colour](https://tomsboxofrocks.com/cdn/shop/files/corundum_pics.jpg?v=1749139402&amp;width=713). Most of this stuff is sent to mass factories for cheap, low-quality cutting; meanwhile, properly-trained precision gemcutters will carefully orient the two colour zones in specific ways to achieve specific effects, like how I used a [pair of Verneuil #61 sapphire](https://imgur.com/a/IheiygU) (pink core, blue rind) to make a ""Winza-ish"" effect. Ever seen a [bullseye-effect “Hanami” cut](https://imgur.com/a/dh8crsi) from [Alternatives Atelier](https://www.instagram.com/alternativesatelier/), or [bicolour or tricolour](https://tomsboxofrocks.com/cdn/shop/files/il_fullxfull.5744934209_j4l9.jpg?v=1715967042&amp;width=720) lab sapphire? That’s how. Flame-fusion material has a bit of a haze in larger sizes due to microscopic curved lines of bubbles, and it doesn’t quite have perfect pleochroism, but is otherwise functionally the same as natural sapphire.

The Czochralski method takes the same raw sapphire powder, and melts it into a liquid, then dips a tiny sapphire seed into the pool and slowly pulls it out, letting more and more sapphire crystallize. This forms a giant ultra-pure cylinder, like [this one](https://imgur.com/vUlSLnw) our partner lab fucked up growing, that can be used for medical-grade lasers or other research. Our lab will be growing sapphires using the Czochralski method (assuming the Kickstarter gets fully funded). These sapphires have none of the haze and have perfectly even colour, but cost at least 10x as much since the growth method is much more technically challenging. Most growers can’t vary amounts of oxygen and hydrogen in the growth chamber, so colours are more limited – but our equipment will have that feature built-in so we can do it. The other disadvantage to Czochralski material is that none of the current growers have standardized their colour offerings, so “dark ruby” or “orange padparadscha” might be a different shade each time. We’ll be standardizing and producing colour charts specifically to help folks out with picking colours.

The “super high quality” stuff is produced by the flux-growth method, sometimes incorrectly called “flux melt” or “flux fusion” – don’t trust a vendor who uses those terms. This is where sapphire powder is dissolved into a bath of special molten salts, then the whole batch is allowed to slowly cool over months or years. The only current grower of flux-growth sapphire is Chatham.

And the absolute, 100% best possible material is grown using the hydrothermal method. A thin plate of ultra-pure white lab sapphire is put in a special chamber with water and sapphire powder, then superheated under extreme pressure and then slowly allowed to cool and depressurize. Sapphire then grows on the seed plate, as visible in this [slice](https://imgur.com/YdAPAWQ). When done poorly, thousands of tiny sapphire columns grow on the plate and fuse together, but this is STILL some of the best material out there, with [perfect pleochroism](https://imgur.com/A2Xfr2f), perfect [crystallographic accuracy](https://imgur.com/vzM4B8X), and absolutely tiny inclusions. When it’s done correctly? It produces the single best synthetic sapphires possible.

What about colour? Natural sapphires are coloured by iron and nickel ([yellow](https://imgur.com/a/sPbemPo)), vanadium (purple/green colour change), chromium (ruby), iron + titanium (blue), and iron/chromium + magnesium ([orange and padparadscha](https://imgur.com/cpseE3w)). Different combinations give different colours. But lab-grown sapphire can use colouring agents that don’t normally show up in natural sapphire – like cobalt (green and blue, typically [strongly zoned](https://imgur.com/aoUSoZh)) and manganese (vivid pink or padparadscha). Some flame-fusion producers are experimenting with cobalt and producing a very inconsistent Paraiba-colour sapphire that’s usually [hazy and heavily zoned](https://imgur.com/62MgD0Z). But our lab has access to supercomputer modelling that can give us the exact growth conditions and heat-treatment conditions to produce a clean, vivid Paraiba-colour sapphire. Likewise, there are some colouring agents that have never been used in sapphire before, like niobium and molybdenum, which should give interesting greys and vivid purples. So we’re gonna try it out.

We’d love for you to check out our Kickstarter. Support the science, help us introduce brand-new exciting lab sapphires to the gem world, pick up a precision-cut gemstone for yourself, and get some stunning jewellery. The Kickstarter will be pre-selling gems, precision-cut in custom Kickstarter-exclusive designs, using the sapphire crystals we’ll be growing: 12 exotic colours, some of which have never been grown before. Our jewellery partners have already designed a bunch of custom rings, earrings, and pendants specifically around the designs too.

I LOVE my ring but over the past few days I’ve been feeling like the sparkle/glittery effect of the radiant is a little too chaotic for me, and find myself drawn to the very clean and nuanced lines of an emerald cut. The radiant is what I thought I wanted, but now I feel unsure. We’re still within the exchange/return window, and both of us just really want me to have something I’m going to love forever, so that part isn’t an issue. 

I guess my question is, has anyone else been here? Is “ring regret” a thing? Should I wait it out and just be happy with it? The diamond is beautiful and I love the unpretentious setting. I just feel that maybe an emerald cut would suit the setting (and me) more. At the same time, I’m worried I’ll get it and have returned this radiant, and regret that lol. I feel all over the place about it. But every time I see an emerald cut, I just find it so lovely and serene to look at. Where as mine feels very hectic. I would LOVE input from anyone. 

If it helps, as a person I’m someone who really appreciates fine things but isn’t “showy”. I think I’m feeling like the radiant feels a bit showy. Again, not sure if it’s just something I’ll get used to, or if I should exchange it while I still can.

Scrolling through Reddit I found out about Ouros Jewels. I wanted a lab diamond because all the pros. I have seen multiple companies on Etsy and other posts on here, but liked Ouros Jewels pricing and designs. Still skeptical, I ran a few designs from their website by my girlfriend to get a feel for what style of ring and what cut of diamond. She loved the pave band and also princess cut diamond. This is my first lab diamond purchase.

Fast forward to the whole process. 

7/10/25 - I inquired about the ring through their WhatsApp. I worked with Harnish. The photos on their website show only one variation, usually a 2 CT diamond. I wanted the 1 CT because my girlfriend thinks the huge diamonds are tacky. He asked for details about the specific ring I wanted like size, carat, the metal. He let me know it takes 1-2 for the ring making process and then ship which varies. (I live in USA) He said it would look good with 1 CT. He answered all my questions thoroughly and I felt more confident about purchasing.

7/12/25 - I was ready to order. I checked their Etsy and their website and the prices were a little different, Etsy being cheaper. They also had a free shipping promo which took a little off the cost. I asked him about it and he gladly gave me the additional discounts and recommended ordering straight through him. I was skeptical, but he sent a PayPal invoice through WhatsApp chat. I placed the order through there and he emailed the confirmation. He sent me all details about the ring.

He let me know that he will ship the ring and IGI certificate separately (this is normal because it keeps their shipping cost down)

2 hours later he sent me the CAD for the ring. It looked great and I gave the okay to move forward.

He also sent the video of the diamond that will be put in the ring with the IGI number. It looked so amazing and the color is actually D. (I think is better than EF) the cut was excellent I was excited this is actually happening. I gave the okay to move forward.

7/18/25 - Harnish messaged me with an update. The ring was in the casting process and he promised to keep my posted.

7/22/25 - The ring was in the filling process.

7/23/25 - He sent me a video of the ring and wanted to confirm my shipping details. He let me know it takes 5-7 business days to ship.

7/24/25 - Tracking information was sent.

7/28/25 - I received the ring. I hunted the UPS guy down in the street. (People like stealing our packages it’s NYC) I proposed the same day and she said yes!

7/31/25 - He said he will ship out the IGI certificate. 

8/2/25 - Tracking information was sent about IGI certification. 

8/7/25 - Received certification. It took a few days extra (Supposed to be delivered 8/4/25) It was stuck in India for a few nights. It was due to UPS or the shipping company, not Ouros Jewel’s fault. 

Safe to say my fiancé was in awe of the ring. I was as well. We’re not used to fancy jewelry or anything like that. The quality of the ring is perfect. The diamond is very clear and sparkly and makes one happy fiancé. We used the iPhone macro lens to see the IGI certification on the side of the diamond. Everything is legit it’s 14K white gold. Our first time purchasing with Ouros Jewels and definitely not our last. We’re looking at earrings and wedding bands from them as well. From purchasing the ring to getting it in hand it took 16 days. For an engagement ring I totally recommend them. I feel like it was very fast considering they’re based in India. The price was amazing a few hundred less than name brands. If you’re debating whether to get a lab diamond, you should go for it.

My boyfriend and I are getting engaged soon, and have gone ring shopping but I want something a little more unique. I absolutely love this ring, but it is from a company that only does natural diamonds. 

I am looking to get one customized - similar to this, but with lab diamonds and an emerald cut center stone.

Does anyone know of how to go about finding a jeweler? In my city there are some large chains and more eclectic local designers (none that have anything similar to this in their portfolio), but this is a big purchase and I want to find someone I really trust. 

Open to anyone in SE Michigan or doing something completely online. 

Thank you so much!!

She said that she liked the idea of having accessible gemstones, but that they’ll never replace a natural one.

Do you guys really think that there is a valid reason to depreciate the value of synthetic and lab grown gemstones just because of their origin? I know that the answer for someone is pretty obvious, but I think that the fact that we learned from nature will always be more valuable that some shiny rock found underground. 

Just think how badly CZ is treated, even if it’s quite a wonderful gemstone that can be used in a wide range of pieces! ",4,15,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/1mlgytp/the_eternal_battle_synthetic_gemstones_vs_naturals/

I had a Saddle Pulmonary Embolism that was blocking both my breathing airways in my lungs. The drs tried everything to break down the embolism but nothing we did worked. After 8 months of trying procedure after procedure I was told I only had about a week left to live and my only option was open heart surgery. I was told only 2 drs in the country could perform the type of surgery I needed done and the top surgeon was in California. That surgeon was at my hospital that week working and agreed to give me the surgery. The surgeon told me it was not guaranteed he would be able to remove much of the embolism (which had become scar tissue due to being there for years unknown to me),and I could still be on oxygen my whole life and I could die during my surgery.It was so scary that even with the surgery I could be strapped to a machine for the rest of my life. My surgery took 17 hours but the surgeon was able to remove 60% of the embolism. We don’t know why I got the embolism or what caused it but I knew I never wanted to go through that again. Through that time in hospital and everything going on with my body,my health, the things my family did behind my back was all out of my control. I wanted to have a sense of control back in my life, I learned how to walk again,I pushed myself to heal and get better. I also decided I was going to lose weight bc I was fat and even though the drs said my weight was not the reason for the clots I didn’t want it to become a reason I get more clots and go through that again. Fast forward to today and I have lost 125 pounds so far (still losing), I have my baby back full time, just bought a car and slowly trying to save up to get an apartment. 
I am designing this ring for myself as a way to reward me for everything I have gone through and everything I have accomplished. This ring is a reminder that I am strong, I am beautiful and I am worthy of love and life. I am getting my ring designed and made by Foreverforlove they are the only place I trust for such a special and sentimental piece.

im in the process of getting information und preparing to buy an engagement ring for the love of my life. My budget is up to around 25k € (as im based in Europe/Germany)

Now i started to read some articles and threads here online and i think i opted for a mined diamond (or maybe you can change my mind, im open and more important she also). After my first few searches in found Brian Gavin with his Black Series or Whiteflash ACA to be much appreciated and recommended, I also found a diamond that fits my imagination: [https://www.briangavindiamonds.com/collections/diamonds/products/1-7-d-vs1-black-by-brian-gavin-round](https://www.briangavindiamonds.com/collections/diamonds/products/1-7-d-vs1-black-by-brian-gavin-round)

Specs should be something around D/E, IF-VS1 for mined or IF-VVS1 for lab, ideal cuts etc for sure, round cut, around 1.7-2.0ct as everything bigger doesn't fit to her :)

Now my questions:

1. am i a clown for spending so much money on a mined stone like that (i think after reading so much its more my personal preference for a mined diamond than a lab grown haha)
2. if i end up changing to LG stones.. are the ones from brian gavin also considered superior to other vendors?
3. how are Brian gavins settings? maybe i should consider just buying the stone from bgd and get a setting from a local jeweler/some known brands?
4. what about light performance on ""ideal cut"" lab grown diamonds? comparable to them from the brian gavin black series?
5. if i end up getting the stone from bgd, how is the buying process? can i just fully trust their shop and their provided informations or should i get a live video of the stone or something? what do i need to ask and check beforehand? what are things i have to consider before?

you see, i know nothing about diamonds really, but i want this to be a very special one for her

i hope you guys can help me out somehow :)",0,9,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngagementRings/comments/1mlriri/first_time_diamond_and_engagement_ring_buyer_here/

We only realized recently that she wants a wedding band that can sit flush against her ring, she doesn’t like V or U shaped bands which is pretty much required given that the setting is attached to the side of the ring, she also doesn’t want to solder the rings together. 

My question is what is the best way to get a ring where the setting is on top of the ring instead of coming up from the sides. Is it just buying a whole new ring and setting and selling the one I have now, is there a way to use the same ring and have someone adjust the setting, can they sort of just melt/cutoff where it is attached on the side?? I’m not very familiar with the prices but figured I’d ask here first.

I’m looking for a 2+ carat, F+ color, VS1/VVS2, excellent cut, step cut lozenge diamond. I’m open to both natural and lab grown options and am curious about the price differences.

So far, I’ve spoken with a jeweler who can custom design the setting exactly as I envision. However, they primarily work with lab-grown diamonds. They quoted me approximately $4,000 for a 2.08-carat, D-color, VVS2 lab-grown diamond. (Not including the setting)

My main question: is this a reasonable price? Additionally, how much would a natural diamond with similar specifications cost? At the quoted price, I still have quite a decent amount of room in my budget.

Im also not sure if aiming for those specifics in a diamond is reasonable but my goal is a very clear diamond. 

Please feel free to ask any questions or request clarification. Thank you in advance!

I’m in the process of sourcing an Old Mine Cut (OMC) cushion lab-grown diamond around **3.25 - 3.5ct** for a custom platinum setting with antique/Georgian cut down inspiration.

My preference has been **G-H colour** and **VS1–VS2 clarity (eye clean)** to keep some warmth and maintain antique vibes without drifting into too much tint.

I’ve had a quote Provence Gems for a **DEF, VVS–VS** stone instead. The price is good, but I’m concerned the whiter DEF might not match the antique look I’m after, especially in platinum.

Would love to hear from anyone who has a general opinion or who has:

* Chosen DEF in an antique cut — did it still look period-appropriate?
* Compared G-H vs DEF in platinum settings for OMC or old cuts

I’m working with Fiorese on a custom engagement ring (colette/georgian cut down setting) and would love some advice from those who’ve gone down the custom cut route before.

Fiorese has quoted me:

* **USD 1,100** to custom cut a 3–3.5ct Old Mine Cut (OMC) cushion lab diamond (about 8.8mm) in GH VS clarity — exactly the chunky antique-style facet pattern I’m after.

The stone would be cut to match a [reference ring they showed me](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMw4pdluu_j/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) that has the perfect look I want for the stone cut.

**The catch:** *They’ve said this custom cut stone will not have IGI certification.*

My concerns/questions:

* Is skipping IGI for a custom cut an issue in terms of value, getting what you've paid for, or peace of mind?
* Would you insist on certification even if you trust the jeweller (it is my first time ordering from Fiorese so unsure here)?
* If I were to have it certified, how much extra might it cost, and how much extra time might it add?
* Has anyone here purchased a custom cut without IGI and been happy with it?

I’m not looking for the paper for bragging rights — my main concern is ensuring I get what I’ve paid for, that the specs are accurate and that I don't receive a chipped stone with noticeable inclusions that I missed over video/photos.

1mrz6jh,EngagementRings,natural vs lab,1755359682.0,2025-08-16,2025,8,Ring progression,"Hi everyone ! I just wanted to share my engagement ring progression in hopes this may help someone 😊 my husband and I were engaged pretty early on in our relationship and we knew we wanted to elope rather quickly. I spent a lot of time trying to find comparisons of labs vs. moissanite, because I was fine with either - I just love sparkle. This is just my personal experience I wanted to share. 

Middle: we decided on a moissanite 18k gold ring from Etsy - can’t speak too much on the quality of the moissanite. I do know it was made in India, they provided some details on clarity and measurements but that’s pretty much it. It IS very sparkly in certain light conditions. We purchased it as a temporary ring until I decided what I wanted, and I wanted to take my time doing so, looking at different designs. What bothered me most about this was how cloudy it looked most of the time. This was something I wasn’t fully aware of! Once again - could totally be the quality of the moissanite (NOT speaking for every moissanite out there). Other than that, it was made very well. After wearing it for about 3 months I 100% knew I wanted a lab diamond. 

Top: I think the cloudiness started getting in my head as time went on so I bought this cheap $26 ring from DHgate or AliExpress - one of those stores and honestly, it wasn’t bad 😂 it was much clearer than my moissanite which I was kind of saddened to see, but you really couldn’t tell the difference between that and a diamond. I bought this just as we placed our order for my lab diamond ring and wore it for about 2.5 weeks. 

Bottom: the way my jaw DROPPED after receiving my ring. It’s a 5.08ct, VVS2-E marquise, IGI certified, 14k gold w/white gold basket, 3mm band. It was made by Clairamor out in Fresno CA, all done online and under $5k. Service was EXCELLENT. communication, excellent. 3D models that were sent were beautiful and accurate and all of my changes I wanted were made and a new models were sent over. It took 2.5 weeks to complete and it was sent via insured overnight delivery. This jeweler is a 3rd generation family owned jeweler who creates a lot of rings with large stones - this was a green flag for me because I knew they would prioritize stability in my design and sort of guide me in the right direction. 

I always had an idea of what I wanted - marquise, gold, tulip basket. But what I learned was I wanted a larger stone so I needed more support (cathedral, which I actually always hated but this is done SO well), thicker band, room for my wedding band underneath, and wanted a white gold basket so my diamond could really shine. I think the gold basket in the moissanite did make it look warmer than what it was - wasn’t a huge fan but i know is all preference for some people. 

Anyways, before I got engaged I was completely fine with having a moissanite because I love the sparkle and spent so much time trying to find side by sides with labs. My moissanite may not be of good quality and not the best representation of a comparison, BUT I wanted to show you anyways ! Lab diamonds are a super affordable option now and I couldn’t have been happier with my choice. I still love my original engagement ring and wear it as a dupe if I travel out of the country or hit the beach. 

I wish you all the best in your engagement ring endeavors! ♥️",191,45,0.95,https://i.redd.it/ogdxazaklejf1.jpeg

We've always known we would go with a lab diamond, and we have done more research than I thought possible into oval diamonds specifically, since I've always been 100% sure that's what I want. 

We've looked at settings both in stores and online and talked to many sales associates. More recently, we spoke to one woman at Diamonds Direct who immediately put both of us off. She asked what we were looking for in a setting and if we wanted a mined or lab diamond. I said lab, and she said ""okay... Why?"" but the ""why?"" came out as less of a question and more of a demand. I started to explain that we're more comfortable for it for budgetary reasons as well as the obvious controversy surrounding mined diamonds, and without me even going into much detail, she cut me off and said ""that doesn't matter. The only reason to choose a lab diamond is for your budget."" 

She then asked how much we knew about oval diamonds, and I said we'd both done tons of research. She says ""like what?"" Her curt tone of voice made it feel like some unnecessary pop quiz, but I mentioned the 4 C's, ratio, table, depth, bow ties, etc, and my boyfriend chimed in to mention CVD &amp; HPHT distinctions, and once again, she cut us off to say ""you know none of that matters, right?"" And she launches into how all lab diamonds are perfect and you don't need any of ""that stuff"" and that we just needed to pick a setting. 

After asking what I wanted in a setting, I told her exactly what I was looking for, but that I hadn't decided whether I wanted a twisted band or a split shank. She then walked away and returns with 10-12 rings, all with twisted bands, no split shanks. She asks me to eliminate the absolute no's and then rank the remaining ones. Once I did that, she removed all but the top 5 and told me I was not allowed to look at any other rings.

We took pictures and then she told me to go look at wedding bands while she spoke to my boyfriend. We left about 10-15 minutes after that completely put off by the whole experience, and absolutely sure we would not be returning to work with her, but I've been wondering if we acted too hastily. We went to another nearby location for the same store the next day, and had a complete opposite experience with another sales associate, so it doesn't seem like it's a company-wide culture but is this common behavior these days?

I found a few beautiful options that I'll try to post at the bottom of the message (new to posting.. pleae be patient). 

I have started emailing with the owner Jonathan Weingarten. He is super responsive and friendly. Things seem almost too easy. After I pay for the diamond, he'll have it shipped to his office and thereafter ""I share with you more information than you can shake a stick at including ASET results, video in natural daylight, spot lighting etc. 360’s in both office and spot lighting … the works."" Is this a normal or typical process? What if I don't like what I just paid for or I don't get a diamond shipped to me?

What also throws me off is that the company does not have google or yelp reviews. The majority are from Sitejabber (is that legit?), and there are some reviews from 2021 or older on Facebook. The return policy seems too good to be true, for me to buy to look at ""with no risk whatsoever"" if I change my mind. I have to pay them upfront and pay for return shipping/insurance, but how would I verify that my diamond is legit, and if I return the product could they say it was not the right diamond?

Reddit seems to contain a random handful of experiences with them but these seem several years old. If anyone has recent experience or feedback about this company that would be so helpful.

Also, these are the two diamonds I have my eye on. Any thoughts on quality and value are completely welcome!

A few weeks back, I noticed that I was missing one of my earrings. Just a simple princess cut diamond stud. The set belonged to my grandmother, and she gave them to me while she was still alive. I’ve worn these earrings every day for the better part of 20-25 years. I’m absolutely crushed that one is now gone. I plan on replacing them with a new set (most likely a lab grown set from rare carat), but not having something of my grandma’s on me really upsets me. 


I still have one of them. It doesn’t feel right only wearing the one, so I’m looking for something to do with the stone. The only jewelry I wear is my wedding ring and a necklace [This necklace to be exact.](https://www.kay.com/flat-figaro-chain-necklace-7mm-solid-sterling-silver-24/p/V-513759504).

Because even just 10 years ago everyone up here where I am in Canada, were all about Canadian mined diamonds. Now suddenly everyone is talking about lab excellent grade perfect diamonds. Am I just old school? I know logically they are chemically the same, but there is just something really unique and different about a diamond that came out of the earth, and made over millions of years - in my opinion of course. But when I see people with these 3-4 carat lab created perfect diamonds, part of me thinks it almost takes away that special ooomf of a diamond? And please no no nooo disrespect to anyone that loves their diamonds. I truly did not know this was a thing until I personally went shopping recently with someone and had an eye opening experience and then came on Reddit and saw this was fairly common, I guess.

I am not wanting to start any fights, just genuinely curious. Was it because we became more aware of issues such of blood diamonds and issues of that nature? If so, that totally makes sense, or just personal preference? Maybe all of the above? Lol.

He took me on a 4-day trip to the beautiful region of Salzkammergut in Austria, where we camped in the car, swam next to waterfalls, foraged mushrooms and just enjoyed what we love to do the most: being in nature. 

On the third evening we set off on a hike, planning to reach the summit by sunset and spend the night somewhere under the open sky. Fun fact, our first date was also a two nights camping trip in the mountains. The trail, however, turned out to be far more challenging than we imagined, some parts went straight up ski slopes that are considered black runs in winter. As the sun began to set, it became clear we wouldn’t make it to the top in time.
Not long after, we noticed a small side path leading to a magical clearing with an abandoned wooden cabin. We spent the night on its terrace under the full moon. The next morning, we woke early and reached the summit around 7 am, just as the sun was rising. The view at 5 Fingers, the (left!) hand-shaped lookout above Hallstatt, was breathtaking. That is where he got down on one knee. The easiest yes of my life. Afterward we enjoyed the sun and I read him from my favorite book, then we ate Kaiserschmarrn at the mountain restaurant (which also matched the ring perfectly. :)) We took the cable car back to the valley and finished the day swimming in a crystal clear river, from where you could still see the hand shaped viewpoint. Truly the most magical proposal I could imagine for us.

My ring is a 14k gold band with a central natural red garnet, flanked on each side by three small natural diamonds.❤️",258,12,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mveitu

My mother gave me her mother’s engagement ring diamond and it’s important to her that I give it to my fiancé. I’m happy to oblige. It’s small, I’d estimate .5 to .75 carats. 

It feels too small to be a centerpiece of the ring and I know my girlfriend doesn’t like the style of smaller diamonds around the center stone. So my idea is to incorporate it into the band itself, hidden from view but visible from the inside if you take the ring off. Also with some small engraving — something about the beauty within or true love is what’s on the inside. Something like that. 

Is this possible? How would I go about accomplishing this? I was imagining ordering a synthetic diamond and then having a local jeweler do a custom setting / band but I’m a novice at this and would appreciate advice.

1mx89fm,EngagementRings,natural vs lab,1755873435.0,2025-08-22,2025,8,Advice on which one is best? I'm leaning towards James Allen ring.,"Hey everyone,

I’m starting the process of buying an engagement ring for my girlfriend and could really use some outside perspective. I’ve done a lot of reading (and even used GPT to help me understand diamond filters and proportions), but some human confirmation would give me a lot of peace of mind.

**What she wants:**

* **Shape:** Oval diamond
* **Band:** Simple yellow gold solitaire (classic, but wedding band should sit flush underneath)
* **Ring size:** 7 (she has fairly short hands, \~6 inches long, petite at 5'2"")
* **Lifestyle:** Very active (boxing, gym), though she’ll likely remove the ring when training

**Filters I’ve been using to narrow my search:**

* **Carat range:** \~2.0–2.5 ct (leaning toward \~2.2 ct)
* **Color:** F–H (but a few options are closer to E)
* **Clarity:** VS2–VS1 (eye-clean without paying for IF/FL)
* **Cut/Proportions:** Very Good to Excellent
* **Depth:** 58–63%
* **Table:** 54–62%
* **Polish &amp; Symmetry:** Very Good–Excellent
* **Fluorescence:** None to Faint
* **L/W Ratio:** \~1.35–1.40 (classic oval proportion)
* **Certification:** GIA preferred, IGI acceptable for lab-grown

From what I’ve read, these ranges are considered “ideal” for ovals in terms of balance between sparkle, face-up size, and value.  
  
I’ve narrowed it down to **3 potential options** (photos attached). I’d love feedback on:

1. Which one looks best to you in practice?
2. If you’d tweak any of the filters (e.g., drop to G/VS2 for value vs stay higher quality).
3. Any general comments or tips

Thanks so much in advance for any advice, this community has been super helpful as I try to make the right choice!

My husband wanted to surprise me with what he proposed with, and we decided we would change it if I didn’t love it. He proposed with a vintage sapphire and diamond ring, but it has right hand ring vibes rather than engagement ring. So, we went to his cousin who’s a jeweler, and designed this ring!! I had her bring in various blue and purple gemstones to look at, but nothing compared to the juiciness and clarity of this Swiss topaz!! It’s 9x7mm oval brilliant cut, 2.6 carats in 14k.
My design was inspired by the Sea Star Solitaire by Anueva Jewelry, gorgeous but we’re looking to buy a house soon and I did not want to spend that much. Topaz is incredibly affordable compared to a sapphire of the same size! I love that my ring is in a lotus setting with cathedral sides, and 6 prongs!

I've seen some people on instagram and TikTok that will source for you for what seems like a moderate fee. Is it worth it to go that route? 

I have no clue what I'm doing. And I just stare at specs I run through ChatGPT and never pull the trigger. I want a nice cut and clarity, but there's so many options. And truth be told, the prices are throwing me off. We paid so much for my much smaller mined diamond, my brain keeps thinking these prices are too good to be true.

As such, I've identified 2 futher diamonds I am considering.

I've listed the diamonds (1 &amp; 2) including GIA Report Screenshots, links to 360 loop videos and some of my thoughts. For completion sake I have also included the 2 diamonds that were in my first post (diamonds 3 &amp; 4 below).

One thing I didn't include the first time was my fiancee's preferences which are: **Cut &amp; Carat (1.5ct - 1.7ct)&gt; Clarity &gt; Colour (as long as it's D-I).** I'd appreciate any further advice from the sub on which option you think would be the most suitable!

Thank you so much in advance!

**Diamond 1: 1.6ct, G, VVS2 ($27,323 AUD) -** [**360 Loop Video**](https://kavalri.com.au/pages/engagement-rings?view=diamond-view&amp;diamond=natural&amp;is_colored=false&amp;id=10609505)

This one seems the cleanest in terms of the clarity characteristics. The proportions from the cut seem to be quite ideal based on some of the extra research I had done (but happy to be corrected). Smallest diamond on the list.

https://preview.redd.it/p7taccwva5lf1.png?width=2600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51bdb989f389d39e53c8d3c5cdf7b385689814f4

**Diamond 2: 1.7ct, G, VVS2 ($27,427 AUD) -** [**360 Loop Video**](https://www.gsdiamonds.com.au/diamonds/product/10we-250504-116_8330677)

This one seems to have all the upsides of Diamond 1, while also being a a bit bigger at a very comparable price. My only concern is in regards to the comment **""Internal graining is not shown. Surface graining is not shown.""** My research seems to indicate that it shouldn't be an issue in a VVS diamond, and I can't seem to spot anything in the 360 video. Again, happy to be corrected!

**Diamond 3: 1.7ct, G, VS1 ($28,995 AUD) -** [**360 Loop Video**](https://pck.blob.core.windows.net/int-multimedia/Stone-multimedia/stone-multimedia.htm?stoneIds=808C7F40-9605-4510-BDE7-D6C40058E728&amp;showMediaType=Video&amp;mediaKey=QX99JES0BU)

Price for this one doesn't seem to reflect the quality (on paper and in the video) when compared to the first 2 diamonds. It was pointed out in the original post that the cut proportions , while still 'Excellent' aren't as good as the others.

https://preview.redd.it/g1nzfgioe5lf1.png?width=2181&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93fa5f36e5dd7eeb92fe4d48d76d6ee53c133a22

**Option 4: 1.7ct, F, VS1 ($29,500 AUD) -** [**360 Loop Video**](https://loupe360.com/diamond/be9e3bbf-0d5a-5037-bfe3-53a8b33b7c89/video/500/500/autoplay)

Priciest of the bunch, however that does come with the F colour. Although I doubt it would be visible to the naked eye, I can see the group of pinpoints in the centre in the loop video.

The solitaire has been purchased and can’t be returned but my fiance isn’t worried about that. Even been together for 10 years and this is a second marriage.

Susan, the support staff I spoke to, was able to answer and accommodate my needs. I was skeptical in purchasing a lab diamond at this time due to tariffs and that I reside in Canada but everything was a smooth process. I got the stone pretty quick after they confirmed they were able to allocate it and it was shipped through Fedex to my door in about 2-3 days. I'll try to update this post once the diamond is set.

-Around 1.6-1.7 natural oval diamond. Gold setting. I’d like a setting that has an interesting floral look to it (see ref photos). I’m open to having small pear accents on the sides, but would also do a solitaire. Want a lower setting, and the least obtrusive prongs possible while still keeping the stone secure.  I also would like to incorporate vintage style milgrain details. Finally, I’d like to have two very small stones on the inside for mine and my partner’s birthstones. 

Obviously I’d love to have a very beautiful stone, but I’m not hellbent on having some crazy sparkly, “perfect” diamond in terms of cut/clarity color. 

Two questions: where in Boston or NYC should look for a custom jeweler to make this, and second, what kind of price range should I expect? I’d like to keep between 15-20k, but not sure if that’s realistic (I do not want lab grown). Don’t want to be excessively extravagant, but willing to spend a decent amount since I will be wearing for the rest of my life.

In a lot of my diamond search, I’m finding such overpriced lab diamonds, and then also learning the fact that the value of the rock diminishes post sale. For example, I went to 2 diamond sellers, one natural only, and one with both lab and natural, and the vendor with both had such crazy prices, that it felt like I was being duped. For example, at the natural place I was offered a diamond for $8k, and the hybrid place, she offered me a diamond with similar stats for $18k natural or like $6k lab. I’m assuming that hybrid place kinda sucks, but in my online research, I’m finding similar situations where a trendy site will have such a seemingly overpriced lab ring. I just kind of think if we are spending that much, wouldn’t I want something that retains more of its value? 

Also reading that natural diamond mine conditions have improved, but a lot of that is published by natural diamond companies lol. 

I guess my question is, what am I missing here lol? Am I just being a natural diamond brat? Are the conditions really better in diamond mines?

For context - I have Tiffany style (not Tiffany) setting solitaire (2.5ct) and I really liked the Tiffany Forever band as a wedding ring.  I asked my jeweller (used many times) to make something similar to go with my ring - I described the look I wanted (which was was to see individual stones rather than just a row of sparkle) and he suggested we go a bit bigger to give the diamonds more definition.  The Tiffany band is a total weight of 0.91ct, meaning each of the seven diamonds are about 0.13ct. I tried on something in my jewellers of a similar weight and didn’t quite have the look I wanted (probably as slightly different style setting) so we agreed on 0.25ct each stone. I was a bit apprehensive as I felt the Tiffany band was perfect in size and sat well with the solitaire.  So the ring was made, the diamonds came in slightly bigger at about 0.27-0.28 each.  I do love the ring but I just don’t know if it goes well with the solitaire, I feel the stones look a little too big and overshadow the solitaire and am thinking I should have just stuck with my instinct and gone with the same size as I had wanted. I have spoken to the jeweller, he is willing to take it back, remake another with smaller diamonds and give a credit for the difference, but it means I will have spent more than I needed and have a lesser ring.  Really unsure and be grateful for honest opinions please.  The first four photos are my rings,  and the last two are the actual  Tiffany rings I tried on in the shop. I think the Tiffany solitaire sits slightly higher than mine too so may also be a factor in how they sit together (I know there isn’t a huge difference in the photos but the Tiffany one does sit better).

1n8dt4l,labdiamond,natural diamond,1757000809.0,2025-09-04,2025,9,Just picked up my green lab diamond 💚,"Sharing my recent purchase of a Fancy Vivid Green radiant cut lab diamond 💚 This is the 2.03ct IF from Calavera. 
Specs are:
	•	Carat: 2.03
	•	Dimensions: 8.41 × 5.94 × 4.2 mm
	•	L/W Ratio: 1.42
	•	Table: 63%
	•	Depth: 70.7%
	•	Clarity: IF
	•	Polish/Symmetry: Excellent
	•	Fluorescence: None

I know stock photos can be overwhelming and sometimes misleading, but here’s how it looks in natural light and in motion.

I also viewed a 2.08ct VS1 (8.36 × 6.08 × 4.19 mm, L/W 1.38) and it was gorgeous too — SUPER sparkly (too sparkly for me), fun, and bright. Honestly, both were beautiful in person. Just want to say: don’t stress too much about VS vs IF. Both can look incredible — it just depends on what you want the stone to represent.


**A few thoughts that might help others:**

✨ **Calavera Review**
	This was my first purchase with them, and I can’t recommend them enough. From start to finish, the process was smooth, transparent, and trustworthy. They were super accommodating, even refunding me on the spot when I decided between stones. That level of professionalism made me feel completely comfortable with my choice. I don’t want to put them on the spot by oversharing specifics, but I will say: the experience was personal, flexible, and way above the bar compared to many online sellers.


💎 **Stock Photos vs. Real Life (for greens)**

	•	Online images of green lab diamonds often look brighter or more “electric” than they do in person. In real life, greens show more nuance — they can shift between vibrant flashes and a calmer, deeper tone depending on lighting. Honestly, I love how dynamic mine is. What ever color you see online, imagine it 1 tone darker in real life. 
	•	Also, remember: stock photos are massively magnified. A 2ct diamond on your screen can take up half your phone, so every tiny inclusion or facet quirk looks huge. In real life at ~8mm, the eye can’t see those flaws unless you’re hunting for them. Honestly, unless you’re shopping 5+ carats (15–20mm stones), it’s only a slight concern IMO.


🛠 **How I Filtered My Options**

	•	I actually compared two stones: an IF and a VS1. And honestly? Both were gorgeous. The VS1 had insane sparkle and life, while the IF had unmatched clarity and depth.
	•	To be honest, if I hadn’t learned what to look for in a green radiant, I probably would have walked away with the VS1 (2.08ct). It was so sparkly and such an immediate “pick-me.” But after a few more glances, I realized the IF had the steadiness and heirloom quality I really wanted.
	•	I ultimately went with the IF because I wanted to begin an heirloom piece — something with prestige and staying power for decades to come. But the VS1 was every bit a diamond and beautiful in its own way. 

🌱 **Final takeaway:**
Don’t be afraid of the process. The right stone will feel obvious once you see it in person. And if you’re considering Calavera — I’d say go for it. They delivered a gorgeous stone and a great experience.

**Happy hunting, everyone 💚**

Love line:
I still remember the day we met at Starbucks 5 years ago. He spilled his latte on my white shirt. Fast forward 5 years later, in the same shop, he suddenly knelt down on one knee,
took out this ruby ring as and said, ""Marry me!”

When I was proposed to last month, I stared at this fiery ruby ring on my finger for three seconds
in a daze — it wasn't a traditional diamond, but it made my heart flutter more than any ring!
It's interesting to say that the movie we watched on our first date was Moulin Rouge!, and Nicole Kidman's line ""The most precious thing in the world is not diamonds, but love"" became our love motto. This ruby is just like our 5-year relationship — the more it settles, the richer it becomes, radiating warm and fiery red light in time.
Our journey for finding the right could be summed up this way:
Not all red stones are called rubies. We learned to look in natural light (mall lights are no good). Rubies are cool-toned red and more eye-catching, while pomegranates are darker in color. If you're afraid of being scammed, be sure to ask the seller for a certificate!
The setting is particular: I tried platinum and yellow gold, and finally found that 18K gold four tongue set! The drop diamonds on both sides are a nice finishing touch — not
stealing the spotlight from the main stone, but indispensable!
We decided that Buying online is more cost-eﬀective than from a shop… Online brands directly connect with the supply
chain, and rings of the same quality (such as 1 carat, G color, VS1 clarity) can save 30% of the
budget. The money I save can upgrade our honeymoon set.
Regarding cutting, the oval brilliant cut (the most popular, can make fingers look slimmer)

1na7dwq,Diamonds,mined diamond,1757184372.0,2025-09-06,2025,9,Any thoughts or advice is appreciated😊,"Hi All!

One year lurker…first time poster here!

Without knowing it, you guys helped me immensely before making my spur of the moment decision to buy my first lab grown diamond! 

All my other pieces are mined (natural - I am not sure of the correct terminology!) diamonds. Not for any other reason other than lab grown diamonds weren’t ’a thing’ a few years ago.

The one piece of jewellery I didn’t own (but wanted) was a solitaire diamond. My engagement ring is a trilogy ring. I had just never found the right one…..until I saw my new ring in a jewellers. I loved it as soon as I put it on and I know that’s all that matters. I wear it interchangeably with the diamond ring I used to wear all the time on my right hand. I enjoy them both equally. 

I live in London and now, ironically, I tend to wear my new ring more in central London because I know it cost a lot less than my other ring. However, it looks more expensive!! Where is the logic in that!? 

Anyway, I wanted to ask your opinion on the ring. I collected my certificate a couple of days ago. The IGI states that my diamond ‘may include post growth treatment’. I could only see a few threads on here about it. There are probably many but I haven’t searched properly! I know lab grown diamonds, especially the CVD grown ones, have a lot higher proportion of needing post growth treatment. I assume that means it went into a HPHT process but wasn’t sure if it may have been irradiated?! I know I am sounding a little crazy here!!! I know that it’s common for coloured/fancy diamonds. Do irradiated lab diamonds have to be disclosed on the certificate? I ask because I read somewhere that colourless diamonds that have been irradiated can be affected later by extreme heat? More so than coloured diamonds. I don’t think irradiation is used commonly on colourless diamonds?? Maybe I should just stop worrying and enjoy it! 

I have attached some photos. I was passing St Paul’s Cathedral and thought it was a good backdrop for the ring😅No one was around so I didn’t feel silly taking the photo! 

I am wearing it with my mined/natural diamond line bracelet in the other photos and I think they compliment each other brilliantly! 

Be grateful to hear your thoughts on my purchase. The ring is set in platinum and I have attached a copy of the certificate for reference. 

Thanks so much in advance😊",236,87,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1na7dwq

Currently I’ve gone on Etsy, EBay, google, chatGPT you name I’ve tried it. I’ve narrowed it down to a seller on Etsy I think but just wanted to get everyone’s insight here as maybe someone has a better recommendation. The two rings I’m looking to get that I won’t go through the original place to get because they’ve been a nightmare and the diamonds the LGD they use are nothing like the pictures. I’ve included pics of the earrings I got from them both the phots on the site and the actual in person pics. The rings use the same diamonds and they are way lighter than what they rings looks like in the pics. 

Into the pics: 
Pics 1-3, are pics of the blue diamond ring that uses the same blue lab diamonds and it next to another blue diamond ring. Pic 2 has the blue lab diamond studs on it the original stock image from the jeweler and the actual in person pics. Pic 3 is just another set of earrings (different place) for context of how often I’ve ordered blue diamond jewelry and it looks completely different in person. Which I get but just be up front about that. Some places are but it’s far and few between. Pics 4-6 are screenshots of the document I sent to him for similar designs I’d be ok with. 

Pic 7 is the pricing that he confirmed he could do it for. Final rings I’d be getting would be and a 2ct blue diamond ring like pic 8 and 9 and a 2.5ct blue and white diamond ring like in pic 10.  Both lab grown.

1. it needs to be resized. my grandmother was a very petite woman and this was sized for her teenaged finger, so i need to have it made slightly bigger and cleaned. however, my mom has a horror story about taking her own vintage engagement ring to a reputable jeweler for just a cleaning and they polished her stone so much that it looks visibly smaller and rattles in the setting, so she and i are both a little freaked out about having that done to something so special. i'll obviously bring it to someone who has specialized knowledge of antique/vintage jewelry and good reviews but i don't know how to shake this fear lol

2. as you can see, it's missing a stone. my grandmother lost it long before she every gave the ring me, and  my partner will replace it, but i'm unsure if we should be looking for an antique/vintage loose diamond or a lab diamond. and i'm having trouble determining what cut the stones in the ring are, can anyone tell? just curious, i know a jeweler will be able to tell me but see above 

3. it has a couple of visible inclusions in the center diamond, i've read that since they are not surface reaching (i don't think) they shouldn't make the stone more fragile, but is that true or should i be considering a different ring entirely for everyday wear? 

4. i've been seeing a lot of people talk about how much they dislike clusters on here - and i tend to agree most of the time, but i love mine, and i enjoy some other antique clusters, so i'm wondering how the people feel about it (i won't be offended, just genuinely curious)

I’m working on a new collection and while I’ve mostly been focusing on clean, minimalist, affordable solid gold pieces so far, I want to start pairing gold with stones. I already have some diamonds (and I understand the undisputed quality of both natural and lab-grown), and I’m aware of moissanite - which seems like the best alternative to diamonds for sparkle and durability.

But I’m curious about semi-precious stones. I’ve been looking at options like sapphire, quartz, topaz, etc. The main thing I’m trying to figure out is: which stones are actually great for daily wear — meaning they won’t lose their quality, scratch easily, or look dull after years of use?

I’d especially love recommendations for white/clear stones that pair nicely with solid gold and won’t push the price point into the “luxury only” zone.

If you were in my position, what would be your top stone choices for durability + beauty + wearability?

I have seen many comments about lab diamonds versus natural, and then after that, the next decision is to find the color, grading, and all that jazz. Let me share my personal story and I hope it helps you in your journey. 

I was married 16 years ago and have been divorced for over 5 of those years. Since then I have been with an amazing man and we have been talking about getting married. When I was first engaged, there was literally zero talk about lab diamonds, likely because it was a newer thing, the internet was there but not as heavily used as it is today along with influencers, vlogs, social media. So when my fiancé at the time went ring shopping, it was to the local jewelry store and his options were natural stone or, well umm natural stones. Labs were a thing but the savings wasn’t much and it was still a relatively novel thing at the time. He bought me a beautiful ring and I still think it is beautiful to this day even though I no longer wear it and have it locked away. 

The next thing I have been reading in posts are the 3 C’s, and certifications, which makes complete sense but it has made me reflect on whether or not it is as important as the diamond industry wants us to believe. In the 9 years I was married, never once was I asked by anyone, not even family of the stone’s grading, or certification. The only time I ever was asked about the certification was post divorce and I had no use for the ring so I wanted to sell it. I reached out to two jewelers, the one where the ring was purchased, who said matter of factly that they did not want to buy it even though I came in with their appraisal document of a value of $14,000, original receipt of $8900, and EGI certification. They also said EGI certification is no longer “ideal” and IGA is “the” certification now, therefore had they wanted to buy, they would not. They suggested I contact another jeweler. I found a jeweler who was maybe interested, so I made the one hour drive to their store. He too said EGI certification was not the in thing anymore but he was willing to buy my $8900 stone for, are you ready? $1100. When you factor in the value of inflation from when the ring was purchased, it was such a shock to me that it felt as though I was giving it away for nearly free. I decided to keep the ring and store it away than to take the money, something just did not seem right about that amount.

So the moral of my story is, do not stress over the certification, the natural or lab stone, because no one will care and they likely will never ask and if they do, they are rude. Just go with what works for your budget, your style and simply love it for it is a physical symbol of your love. That is all that matters.

It has a 1.8 mm band that tapers towards the front. We got it from Moissanite Co. for about $2400. My main concerns are that the oval diamond has a noticeable bow tie in some lighting/angles, and the band might be too thin for ideal durability in the front. It doesn’t say on the website how thin the band gets, just that it tapers. Should I keep it or try to find another one that has less bow tie and a thicker band? I’m worried that any other place will be much more expensive and not quite the same style that I like. Any advice is very appreciated! 😊",1,0,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nipf0h

I accidentally left my designer purse behind on the bench outside of the international terminal while waiting on Uber, which had my wallet and rings inside—the ones I had taken off because my fingers were so swollen. They were a 2-carat high-quality center stone with 2 carats TW in diamond bands, all mined diamonds I had worn for 18 years. (Sadly, they weren’t insured.)

After sharing my story on Reddit, I started learning about lab diamonds. With private school tuition and kids in the mix, I just couldn’t justify spending that much on mined diamonds again. Nervous but hopeful, I decided to take a chance on Calavera NY since their prices were only a fraction of what I had paid before with mined diamonds. 

I ended up buying a IGI-certified 4.06ct round diamond, VVS2, ideal cut, color E, set in a hidden halo band from Calavera New York. I ordered it on August 8, and it arrived yesterday 9/15. The band is thinner than I expected, but the diamond itself is absolutely stunning. I’m so happy I went with lab diamond route. ",301,46,0.99,https://v.redd.it/4fenhue2tkpf1

I’m looking to buy a lab-grown diamond tennis bangle (14K or 18K gold or platinum ). I’ve seen some pieces on secondhand luxury sites, but I’d prefer recommendations for reliable jewelers or online retailers that specialize in quality lab-grown diamond jewelry.

My priorities:
	•	Real solid weight and not hollow gold
	•	Secure clasp (since it’s a bangle, not a flexible bracelet)
	•	Well-matched diamonds in terms of cut, color, and clarity
	•	Good return/exchange policy

If you have experience buying tennis bangles, I’d love to hear about:
	•	Stores or websites you trust
	•	Price ranges I should expect
	•	Things to watch out for (e.g., flimsy gold weight, poor diamond matching, etc.)

Main major revisions: 
- raise stone height above bezel line (yes I know the stone is different and different) 
- thin bezel lip around stone 
- find a way to match the original half circle setting mount more. We discussed slightly altering the inspo design to strengthen it, but it was a VERY subtle suggestion that is not a completely different mounting shape for the head 
- send in white gold, we discussed that I want rhodium plated white gold and he just must’ve forgotten 

He sent this a week late after we called asking about when it would be ready (he said 3 weeks to CAD, it had been 4) and we feel like he must’ve just rushed it. This place has amazing reviews and we loved the initial process, but are really disappointed with the lack of attention to detail and timeline so far. 

How many revisions is too many? Are these normal issues in the first round? 

I’m feeling so disappointed and also like embarrassed to want so much shifted. Is what I’m asking for too hard? 

I almost got the original design in moissnaite and yellow gold just to know I’d like the design, but my partner didn’t want me to settle for the wrong color and not having a diamond when it’s what I wanted.

1npl34h,jewelry,lab grown diamond,1758741015.0,2025-09-24,2025,9,Should I buy the ring?,"When engagement ring shopping with my fiance, I fell in love with edwardian triple stone twist rings. I was really keen to find a vintage ring that fit my style and this design was lovely. Unfortunately, we couldn't find any rings in that style in my size. In the end, we chose a lab diamond ring which I adore so it all worked out happily! 

I'm now on the hunt for a travel ring and have come across a beautiful 9ct ring on Ebay in the exact style I fell in love with! It fits my budget but it's not ""cheap"" so looking for advice! 

I am hesitant for the following reasons:

- although the seller has had their account for 7 years with over 50 positive reviews, most are as a buyer. There are about 10 seller reviews and of them, only 1 is for a high value piece of jewellery (positive). 

- they have sent me pictures of the engravings but they are faded and the purity of the gold can't be confirmed. 

- the seller seems to be pretty clueless about jewelry and admits this themself in the listing. Initially they had heavily overestimated the size of the diamonds (listed centre stone as 2.5cts) so I sent them a gentle nudge to advise it's highly unlikely that the diamonds are the size they indicated and they adjusted their listing. To be clear, didn't advise them to change the price. 

- the seller doesn't accept returns and I'm not very familiar with ebay's not as described policy. 

So.. What do you think? Take a punt and treat myself or leave it far alone?

Some of you might’ve seen me posting here before - I’m building a small solid gold jewelry brand and have been asking for your input along the way. It’s been super helpful, so I’m back with another question.

This time it’s about stones. I know a lot of people see cubic zirconia as a no-go, but I wanted to ask honestly:

* Would you buy solid gold jewelry if the main stone was CZ (to keep the price really affordable)? 
* Do you feel like CZ lowers the whole value of the piece, even if the setting is real gold (in our case 9K - we are European business, where 9K is pretty standard)? 
* Do you see CZ as fun/wearable, or more of a “troublemaker” in fine jewelry?

I’m really curious because I know some people are all about lab diamonds or moissanite, while others are totally fine with CZ as long as the design is pretty and the price is really affordable.

I’ve been seeing that lab diamond values are dropping pretty quickly, but resale isn’t really a concern for me. At the same time, I don’t feel like I need a mined diamond just to say it’s mined.
I’ve also been looking into moissanite, but I keep wondering if it’s going to end up in the same boat as lab diamonds (or even like cubic zirconia in the long run). Basically, I don’t want something that feels “cheap,” but I also don’t want to spend extra just for the branding. I’m fine investing in something valuable, as long as the value is actually in the stone and not just the name behind it.
What I’d really love is an oval gray or purple stone, but I’m open to other options too. The catch is that I’m really hard on my rings—I never take them off—so durability is a big deal.
The picture is of my OG ring, which I found in an antique store for $350 about 25 years ago. I still love it, but I’m ready for an upgrade.

This is from over a year ago but just discovered the engagement ring subreddit lol. The ring is a custom Toi et Moi Emerald and Marquis from Vrai. The Emerald is 1.66ct Excellent G VS1 and the the Marquis is 1.59ct Excellent G VS2. I believe she's a size 3.75-4. Overall happy with how it turned out. She still stares at it daily so I think this ring will do 😂.

The now wife didn't care for natural diamonds VS Lab and we went Lab Grown with Vrai - custom setting. I read some reviews that back in the day that their settings weren't very sturdy so I actually tried to physically rip the diamonds off by hand when the ring came in and the basket didn't budge. Pretty solid thankfully.

Originally we were supposed to just ""look"" but she ended up falling in love with these stones so I went a head and bought them that same night without her knowing lol. We're filipino and her inspo for the ring was Hart Evangelistas stacked engagement rings that look like a massive Toi et Moi (except it's 3 rings lol).

- Calavera New York is often cited in the subreddit for good prices. Also Aurelienne and Ruby Harper
- Rare Carat can price-match using IGI certification ID. Leela Diamond for Canadian location which avoids extra import fees, shipping etc. Once stone is in Canada the shipping is like overnight (from Toronto to AB) and returns are easy too if the stone is not for you.
- don’t just rely on photos but watch videos from all angles, depth of the stone can affect how much light can be refracted and can look dull if not set correctly, and can even show dark spots like bowties on ovals
- cut matters if you want more sparkle: radiant or round cut brilliant. Something like emerald or old mine cut or european (anything with less cuts) will need more depth or bigger stone to show the sparkle. 
- cut and clarity matter much more than colour, especially as the trends are shifting towards coloured diamonds given they are much more difficult to create
- also yellowy / champagne coloured diamonds look fantastic on 14k or 18k yellow gold, the colourless almost defeats the purpose on yellow gold bc it will “tint” yellow
- when setting the stone, do not use factory default settings as each diamond is unique and have to be flush to the setting. Not always the case with mass-produced settings. 
- once you have your loose diamonds, find a local jeweller to set it. How do people find local jewellers and how can you pick the right one for you? Have you ever tried outsourcing the setting?

Shown on a size 7 finger in a temporary setting. 

Newly engaged (yay!) and getting to design my ring! I JUST received these lab diamonds and would love feedback to help in decided which (or neither) stone to keep for a solitaire engagement ring! I understand that bow ties are a feature of oval cuts with the degree varying but I would like to minimize as much as possible. With that being said, would the bow ties of these stones be considered minimal? I catch the stones in one light/angle and think they’re minimized then in another it’s all I can focus on. Do I have unrealistic expectations with the stones or could I do better at reducing? 

As the excitement and shock has settled a bit and I’ve viewed in various light settings (outside, fluorescent, indirect, etc), I’ve fixed less and less on the bow tie and am appreciating the cut and ratio of the stones. Just when I think I like one stone more, I go back to the other and am so torn. In my opinion the 5.09ct looks more defined with cleaner cuts on the top and bottom than with the 5.27ct, which resembles a crushed ice look in person (doesn’t photograph as well as the 5.09ct). However, I think the 5.27ct is more fiery in person. I go back and forth on the slight difference in ratio, I think I prefer the 1.55. I LOVE the size! The price difference is within my budget and not a huge deal as I am willing to pay for a better quality stone. Any feedback or comments on the cut of the stones would be greatly appreciated - maybe it’s all in my head and I’m being too critical.

If it matters for setting, I’m thinking 2mm yellow gold band, white gold or platinum low donut setting with a solitaire pave hidden halo and claw prongs; wedding band being a simple open gold band. ",3,24,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nuptbw

It features a \~.6ct emerald cut diamond (it's mined and I can’t recall exact size but .6 is close) with a double halo and bridge accent setting with pave split shank band. The wedding ring is a matching pave band, now attached to the engagement ring.

My ring felt unique and different even at the time. I love its vintage feel and old Hollywood shimmery glitz. The shimmer of the halos and pave bands catch the eye, bringing the elegance of the emerald cut front and center.

While rings today often have much larger stones than mine, I still get compliments regularly. It’s a stunner even at a lower carat. To me the ring’s beauty is timeless. 

When I look at the many beautiful rings posted on this sub, I sometimes feel a pang of envy or regret that my ring isn’t like the ones of today. Then I look at my ring and remember this is a ring a much younger version of me would have picked too. It is me through and through, regardless of my age or the current styles.

However, I find myself wanting more jewelry, but I am a broke college student and barely have anything to my name in addition to struggling to find a job. Ive tried putting on cheap jewelry but it feels borderline disrespectful in a way and always looks weird next to this bracelet (the picture really doesn't do it justice). I wouldn't mind saving up some money for a decently nice piece if it would look good, but I just don't know what would be worth it, especially because I really don't want to spend over like 500 for a single piece although I know that might be unrealistic.

He also mentioned that lab-grown stones can offer near perfect quality (most likely perfect) at a lower price, which got me thinking.

Personally, I’ve always valued the rarity of natural stones. To me, part of their appeal is the history and uniqueness behind them. But after hearing different opinions, I’m wondering if lab-grown stones could be just as good, especially given the recent price changes.

I’m working on a custom *toi et moi* **pendant necklace**. I already have stones picked and verified, so the main question now is **who to trust for the setting, chain, and labor**.

I’ve reached out to several jewelers and asked for **price matching on the diamonds**. At this point the decision really comes down to the **quote for the necklace build itself (gold, chain, CAD, and setting work)**.

Here’s where I’m at:

* **Loose Grown Diamond**: Provided CAD upfront, reasonable pricing
* **Provence Jewelry**: Lowest quote all-in, but CAD only after a deposit via Alibaba.
* **Rare Carat**: Provided CAD upfront, higher quote than LGD
* **Debebians**: Also quoted, but they came in significantly higher, so I’ve ruled them out.

So diamonds by the yard necklaces are my jam.  Simple and elegant.  I prefer the fancy cuts over round diamonds.   A relative gifted me with nine loose natural diamonds that are marquise cut and they range in size from 50 points to 70 points.  

I want to augment the natural diamonds with similarly-sized pear shaped diamonds (and maybe Asscher shaped too) and make a by the yard necklace out of them in white gold or platinum.  I don't know if we are allowed to post links but there is a shop on Etsy (Ouros) that sells lots of lab diamonds that I could find in similar size. 

I am not looking to get the diamonds bezel set--would prefer a simpler setting, but regardless the labor for something like this will eat me alive, not to mention the price of gold--when I looked the other day platinum was actually cheaper.  I'd be fine with that.  

Things I've thought of:  

1.  buy the stones online and get them set locally. I do know someone who is very skilled but she's also very expensive.  

2.  Take the lot of diamonds to NYC with me and buy the lab diamonds there and use someone there to make the whole thing.  (Vendor names welcome.)  

3.  Just forget it and make the necklace an all lab diamond creation and partner with a vendor overseas.  (Suggestions welcome.)   I happen to have nine nieces on my spouses side.  I'm close with them.  Give them each one of these diamonds.   (I'd get each diamond set as a pendant first, which will also be expensive.)  BONUS:   Going all-lab for my necklace may be the most cost-effective.  This relative was toxic and so is the rest of the family on my side.  This relative would be turning over in her grave at the thought some of her things going to my husband's side of the family.  The thought of that makes me happy.    

Opinions?  Suggestions?  Things I'm not thinking of?

Unfortunately I just cant make my mind up. It seems that I don’t like a specific style but rather a lot of things. I now have a favorite and two other rings that come close up. Since I still am insecure and unfortunately also worry about what others might think I wanted to get some opinions from people on the outside that don‘t know me or my typical style.

The first one is 14k Gold with. 0.44 ct tourmaline with 12 diamonds (together they are 0,06 ct) P1/H. This one is my favorite, but I do worry that it may look too small and people will make fun of it.

The second is 14k gold with white topaz.

The third is 14k gold, 0,25 ct diamonds Sl1 with a synthetic sapphire.

The fourth omega is the kind of style I want for my wedding band. I want to wear both rings together but am not opposed on wearing them on different fingers.",4,7,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nytxhz

After years of working from home, I’m finally heading back into the office and honestly it feels like learning how to dress all over again. The best part of WFH was not stressing about outfits, but now I want to look more polished without buying a whole new wardrobe.

My closet is very simple: mostly plain neutral blouses and slim trousers. To elevate them, I’ve started incorporating some jewelry. A few earrings and bracelets I got from Zalori that I think have already made my basics look less plain and more intentional. It’s amazing how small details can shift the whole vibe.

I’m second guessing everything at this point and need some advice. Now I’m stuck on what to add next. Should I bring in a statement necklace to break up the monotony? Try subtle rings that don’t overpower?",2,4,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/1nyu4aq/jewelry_as_workwear/

1nzu6hk,jewelry,lab grown diamond,1759782042.0,2025-10-06,2025,10,Startup advice,"I’m working on an idea for a small engagement ring store in a religious college town (thousands of engagements a year) that focuses on lab-grown diamond engagement rings. 

I don’t have a background in jewelry, but I do have a lot of experience in starting and running multiple other businesses and specialize in marketing and sales.  I think there’s an opportunity here for something fresh and affordable in my area.

The general idea is to use a supplier like Stuller to order finished rings and lab-grown diamonds once a customer chooses their setting and specs.
The shop itself would mostly have demo rings and sample stones so people can try things on and see different styles in person.
The goal is to make it feel high-end but still budget-friendly without needing a massive amount of inventory or an in-house jeweler.
I’d mainly act as the retail face and local brand, not a full custom jeweler.
Basically the thought is to be reselling through a trusted supplier instead of manufacturing or setting stones myself, and using only lab grown diamonds to keep rings as affordable as possible for young couples still in college. 

I’m trying to figure out if this model actually makes sense before diving in too deep.A few questions for those that know this industry:
Is building out a storefront without doing my own bench work realistic?I’ve heard Stuller is amazing to work with, any other companies like them to look into? Any other red flags or advice for someone new to jewelry but strong in sales/branding?
Appreciate any insight, I’m trying to make this a legitimate business, not a gimmick, but I also want to keep it lean and modern.  Im extremely scrappy and love to hustle but also acknowledge I have zero experience in this industry and would love an honest perspective.  Thank you!

That ring is a Solitaire diamond cushion ring from Paris, made in the 1910s, and it’s a true vintage treasure. The “old cut” refers to an early hand-cut style like the Old Mine or Cushion Cut, created before modern precision tools. These diamonds were shaped by candlelight to glow warmly rather than sparkle sharply, giving them a softer, romantic look.

At 1.77 carats, the diamond is impressive for the Edwardian era (1901–1915), when craftsmanship and elegance mattered more than size. Parisian jewelers at the time were masters of detail, often using platinum or yellow gold with fine milgrain and filigree work. The cushion shape, with its rounded corners and domed crown, was a signature of old-world luxury.

The solitaire setting, meaning one prominent stone, symbolized purity and devotion, making it the ultimate engagement ring style.",42,2,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o2rjs2

But…,"TLDR; I messed up and wasn’t honest about the size of center stone I wanted, and idk if/how I should bring up that I want a slightly larger one bc I feel like the ring looks awkward/sad with this size. (Yes, I know it’s my fault :(  …) 


Fiancé did a great job and I truly love my ring. The setting is exactly what I wanted, but I wish the center stone was bigger…not bc I’m a flashy person or pouty about it in a “ugh I can’t believe how small it is” way, but bc I feel like the setting/design around it was made for at least a 1.3-1.5c or even just oval. Like, I don’t like that the sides next to the center stone kinda dip down, and I feel like that makes it look even smaller. I saw the 2nd pic somewhere on Reddit and was like OMG that looks WAY better!! (I’d already had these feelings way before seeing it.) 

It’s also a lab grown, which is what I wanted bc cheaper, but just read the policy and apparently it’s not eligible for a trade-in or upgrade, so I guess it’s…worthless??? He had the ring for over a month before he proposed, so par for the course for my luck, the 60-day “guarantee” window ended last week. (Didn’t know until about an hour ago, and don’t even know if it would’ve mattered.) 

Also, we did talk about this a bit before he bought it. I’m really bad about downplaying my wants and needs in general, and I knew when we were talking about it that in my heart I did want a bigger stone. I just felt guilty/greedy/spoiled/embarrassed if I said something different at the time. Now I regret it… I know it’s all my fault for not saying that when we looked at rings or within the first few days. I just wish I was “obsessed” with my ring like everybody else. Like, thinking about a flat lay wedding photo just makes me sad as I feel like it just looks awkwardly small. 😞 

Last also, I feel like this is obvious to everyone bc I’ve legit had less than 10 people say it’s gorgeous or even just pretty. The ones that did were my best friends and mom and dad, and they weren’t even all that enthusiastic. His parents/family gave a polite “oh, how nice” and I could just tell they felt awkward. Everyone loves him/us together so I know 100% it’s not bc they think I shouldn’t be marrying him or him me. I’m certain about this. I know it shouldn’t matter what anyone else thinks, but this has only exacerbated the feelings I already had about it…

Idk how to bring this up or if I even should. He already spent more than I know he wanted to, although financially, he would be able to afford more without breaking the bank at all. He’s a very frugal person (which I do appreciate most of the time lol) so I’m struggling with what I should do. I can’t afford to buy a new stone myself - regardless of natural v lab grown - otherwise I would. 

Thoughts?? Do I just suck it up and maybe in 1-5 years try to upgrade then?

Due to his job, my husband never wears his. I worn mine for a year or so but when covid started it, I was washing my hands so often and didn't want to risk it dropping in the sink at work. I also worked at a dealership so I was opening and closing car doors all day and didn't want to scratch people's cars.
I work a much more relaxed office job so I want to start wearing it again. 
I do not know how many carats the engagement ring is. My FIL owned a jewelry shop and this was basically our wedding gift. I do know that the band is platinum. My old boss who was very into jewelry said its a very high grade diamond and im not going to ask since it's a gift. The band I ordered myself a few years back. My FIL had asked if I wanted a wedding band before we got married and I didn't want to impose on another gift. The band is white gold(im too poor for more platinum). My husband's uncle gifted him a nice used watch. I think they got it from a customer with a matching woman's watch. I declined because I was too shy. I kick myself sometimes for not accepting since it was a matching set.
For immediate family members, wedding gifts are in the form of jewelry(juusttt incase the country collapse and you gotta run!)

They loved the original ring, and the only thing that could have made it better was if the diamond was grown instead of mined - they're a scientist, so the romance would have been the power of human achievement. The extra spin I'd like to put on the replacement is to get a main stone with some intentional glow, so they can have some of that sci-fi element.

somehow, searching for the word phosporescent didn't turn up as many hits as I expected for a sub this big, but I also admit I'm on the official mobile app, so I'm not browsing optimally.

Can I have advice on seeking a ring and stone with these properties? We're in new york city but I would consider online or in person. The insurance was for up to $7k.

The original ring was platinum, cathedral set with 0.5 ct of pave leading to the main stone. The original stone was .75 ct. I think it had 6 claws? I could dig up the receipt for more accurate details.

I absolutely loved my original engagement ring, but it was two sizes too small after 7 years and had challenges with resizing that I didn’t want to repeat in the future if my size changed again. So, to honor it, we used the original center diamond and designed an art deco-inspired target ring. 

The center stone is a natural diamond, about 1/2 carat (not sure the exact specs). Around it are rubies and additional lab-grown accent diamonds down the side. 14k unplated white gold and on a size 6.5 finger. We recreated the engraving that was on my original ring down the sides and on the basket. I primarily wear vintage and antique jewelry, so this fits right in, vibe-wise. Though, it is a little shinier than I’m used to with my antique rings. Anyone here with an unplated white gold ring? Does it get a nice patina over time? In person it looks so new and shiny that it almost reads not real to me haha but it’s one of the only newly-made pieces I’ve ever worn so I’m sure I’ll get used to it.

Is Rare Carat the best option for this? I know they do price matching on the stones, but I wasn’t sure how their settings compare or if there are better places to look.

I’m also debating whether to pick something out myself or loop my wife in. Rare Carat at least gives me something visual to show her so we can narrow it down together.

Overall, I couldn’t be happier. Their designs layer so well together, and it was easy to mix natural and lab diamonds seamlessly. How do you think it turned out and can you tell the difference between the natural and lab diamonds? ",53,11,0.91,https://i.redd.it/38wl60qnalvf1.jpeg

They said the stone is star ruby, with diamonds on the side on a white gold band. They think it’s natural ruby, and if I had to guess it’s 2.5 carrots. 

I’ve never heard of star ruby before, but from what I can see online it’s not common and quite pricey.

I’m currently on a mission to find the perfect engagement ring for my partner, and it’s been quite a journey. I’ve decided to stop visiting physical jewelry stores because I can never find the kind of style I’m looking for — something floral or nature-inspired, with delicate flower details.

So far, I’ve only found rings that match this aesthetic on Etsy, but that’s where my concern starts. I came across a ring that I’m almost certain my partner would love, but I’m getting nervous about whether it’s safe to buy.

The price is around €1,400, and I’m worried about paying that much and not receiving what I ordered (e.g., real 18k gold, proper craftsmanship, Lab created gemstone, etc.).

For reference, here’s a photo of the ring and the link to the shop:

Ideally, I'd like it in 14kt gold. Don't care whether the stones are natural/lab nor do I care about the color/inclusions/shape since they're inverted. How much would something like this run for if it were to be custom-made? Anyone in particular I should reach out to, to get this made?

Hello! We are looking for a yellow lab grown diamond for an engagement ring. We are wondering how to choose the correct color of the diamond as we want a warm and soft diamond look in a yellow gold ring. We dont want a ring that is screming neon yellow, but rather something that is appealing and intereisting to look at, but not intensly eye catching way.

We live in a small city, and have therefore not been able to find a yellow diamond where we live, and have decided to order a yellow diamond and place it in a ring. We are therefore wondering if you have any advice on which diamond to get and not get. We have found some diamonds that hopefully are usefull, and will be adding them and two inspiration photos when it comes to color of the entire look.

Hope for your advice, best regards a newly engaged couple.

I’ve come to find this lab diamond that’s within my budget from Ritani, and I wanted to know peoples opinion on the specs. 

Also, I need some advice on what to do after I’ve purchased the diamond. 
I found a ring that I really like from brilliant earth. Would I take this design to a jeweler and ask them to design something similar or do I need to take extra steps? I only ask this because I don’t plan to buy the diamond from them. 

Thanks for the advice!

Everyone that sees it comments on how gorgeous it is and some people have made comments about the size which makes me uncomfortable.

Easier to see in video: https://imgur.com/a/ring-with-moisture-trapped-underneath-jRJ9DwF

***

Hi all, hoping for some insight from anyone familiar with jewellery design or stone setting!

I bought a fine-jewelry ring about a month ago — a natural watermelon tourmaline, set in solid gold with a diamond halo.

I noticed water gets trapped inside the setting (e.g. after handwashing) — it’s not fogging or condensation, it’s literally sloshing around under the stone and takes 24+ hours to clear.

The jeweller told me this is normal and not a workmanship flaw, explaining that the setting “isn’t watertight.” To me, that sounds odd — water can get in, but not out? They said they strongly recommend avoiding all contact with water (as well as oap, or cleaning products). So, I have to take my ring off every time I was my hands? That seems like a recipe for losing it, if I’m ever to wear it in public… 
They also suggested I ship it back to Europe (I’m in Canada) for ultrasonic or acetone cleaning to remove the moisture, at my own shipping cost. Would either method be safe for watermelon tourmaline? Since the liquid can’t escape, it seems like the stone could be exposed to acetone for a long time.

I’d love to hear your thoughts:
- Is this normal or acceptable craftsmanship?

- Should fine-jewellery rings be able to handle quick handwashing without trapping water?

- Are ultrasonic or acetone methods safe for watermelon tourmaline?

Thanks so much in advance for any professional or experienced input!

I’m looking for a lab grown oval diamond but I don’t want a bow tie. 

I came across several custom cuts like: crushed ice, Portuguese cut, old mine cut, and I see some smaller diamond sourcerers offer their own custom cuts (ex: bijou labs has what they call a constellation cut and astral cut, another family owned company in Canada has their own disco ball but). 

These cuts basically create more smaller facets that eliminate the bow tie. My question is, would more smaller facets cause more windowing/less sparkle compared to a modern brilliant cut? I know the modern brilliant is made to maximize the sparkle but I haven’t seen any of these fancy cuts in any store so it’s hard to tell what it would be like. 

Another question I had was, if I were to go for a brilliant cut oval, is there a ratio that has a higher chance of having very little bow tie?

There is a certain pendant that spoke to me but TBH it is really not my thing. They wanted $2200 for it. I think I will offer them $1700 and hold my ground if it checks out otherwise.

  
The dude says it is ""natural diamonds"". I really have no idea how much I can trust these people. It is a bit of a ghetto type store. They sell grills etc so passing off mossanite or something to me doesn't seem that unlikely. Sorry - just my impression of life. No offense to lovers of grills.

Should I have them test the gems to make sure they're not mossanite in front of me with a conductivity checker?  I don't care if the diamonds are lab grown or natural. I just don't want mossanite when I'm paying for diamonds.

The other thing is I read about ""diamond chips"" but I don't see much talk about it. Is this something I can tell by looking at it under 10x ? Will there be a lack of facets? Or is that not really a thing to worry about?  I barely see it mentioned on the web but most websites about diamonds are trying to sell them not educate you.

  
This is a pendant with an initial but it also has a crown. They're both iced out.  5 carats of 10k gold. Which seems pretty cheap to me and questionable whether someone would bother with ""real diamonds"".

What is my play here? Thoughts?

I would never have a custom piece made. I'm only buying this because it was already made and if I can get a decent deal on it, I'd like it just cuz ...  It is the initial of both my first and last name and the crown just makes a cute thing.

Like, really don’t. Its the right metal, lab diamonds like I wanted but its a Toi et Moi ( which I hate ) and the overall vibe of the ring is not something I would have looked twice in a store. 

I love marquise, oval or pear cut, but mine are just 2 squares. I have a pinterest board filled to the brim with options, ready for him but he went and bought it before I could show him

You see, his proposal was a disaster with a ring I hate, and I felt like I couldn’t say both things to him, it would have crushed him, so I chose to be truthful about the proposal and the fact that I hated it, thinking I could learn how to love my ring. Spoiler : I cant. 
Its ugly for me and not something I would wear. 

Sometime I just want to leave it at home, Im sad because if I dont have it, it feels like Im not married to the love of my life, but Im happy not having to see it during the day.

Here are the specs straight from the listing:

* Natural diamonds (They could be lab, I don't have a preference)
* Total Carat Weight: 0.15 CTW
* 16 stones (tiny pavé accents)
* Clarity: I2
* Colour: I–J
* Round cut
* Claw/prong setting

I totally get that these aren’t high-end stones, but at that size, does clarity even matter in a practical sense? Like, would you actually notice the difference between I2 and, say, SI1 in a pavé band this small?

The ring looks nice in person, and the price is pretty reasonable compared to other options. I just want to make sure I’m not missing something obvious about durability or long-term sparkle.

Would you buy something like this from Ben Moss for everyday wear, or is it better to spend a bit more for higher clarity/lab-grown stones instead?

I am just trying to balance looks, quality, and not overpaying for specs that don’t matter at this scale. Thanks in advance!  *(*For context, I’m in Canada.)

We found a natural stone we both love, priced at $18,000—far more than I was hoping to spend. My partner is comfortable with it. Since the jeweler had to return it to the vendor, I felt some pressure to make a decision after seeing it twice in person. I let my partner put down a $6,000 deposit.

However, last night I barely slept, and today I feel we may have rushed into a decision. I feel so guilty for potentially wasting the jeweler’s time after eight months of searching, especially if we might have focused too much on natural stones when lab options could have been better. 

Spending large sums is stressful for me—I’ve even felt conflicted about having a wedding because of cost—so I think I let the process and my partner’s preferences push me beyond my comfort zone. I feel so anxious at the thought of calling the jeweler now. Absolutely mortified and sick to my stomach. My partner is really upset too because he says the process should make us happy and I cried all day yesterday. He’s upset that I didn’t realize before now that I was uncomfortable with spending this much. 

What should I do? Should we ask to switch the stone for another natural diamond we liked that’s less expensive? Should we be honest and say we’re not ready? Or should we explore lab diamonds now? I think I would feel too mortified to ask this jeweler to see lab diamonds at this point.

My partner and I have started the search. Budget is 30k for a Natural Radiant Diamond. 

I have a size 5 finger and for reference this ring I’m wearing is a 3 ct Lab (obv not fitted &amp; more sparkly and perfect than the natural I will get). I loved it in the store but now I’m thinking is it TOO big?? I don’t want it to look like too much for everyday wear or too flashy. 

The last picture I believe is a 2.5 next to the 3 which almost looks too small?! So now I’m thinking 2.8 might be the perfect happy medium.

We both really like the salt &amp; pepper diamond look on platinum band (the photos show rose gold and gold bands, respectively). We're looking at two different stacks:

The first is a simple hexagon solitaire with bezel setting with (2) wedding band stacks: 1 salt &amp; pepper kite with ombre accents, and 1 salt &amp; pepper pear with clear accents.

The second is a black kite with marquise setting with 3-diamond cuff. 

  
Obviously, we've already found a place that does this (and we don't mind going to them) but were kind of hoping to find lab grown diamonds for this. My fiance has very expensive taste (he chose the first ring) and while I love it, I don't want him to spend an arm and a leg on this purchase - I'm cool with him spending just one arm ;) 

We're also preferably looking for somewhere in NY's Diamond District to help us out with this custom pick, if possible. 

  
If anyone has any recommendations on jewelers that might be able to help me with this non-conventional engagement/wedding set, I'd really appreciate it!!

Just more evidence that natural diamonds are mostly marketing and they’re trying to figure out how to lure people away from labs.

The really interesting thing to me is if they didn’t purposely limit supply, they would be competitive with lab diamonds, but they’re too greedy to. 

From the article:

“Industry at global diamond giant De Beers, said a rebound in demand for natural stones would not happen by itself, but requires initiatives such as the Luanda Accord.
That is an agreement by diamond-producing countries and firms to create a collective marketing fund for natural diamonds.

Under the agreement, countries such as Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia and South Africa have committed to allocate 1% of their annual diamond sales revenue to a campaign to promote natural diamonds.”

1ofuoqb,EngagementRings,natural diamond,1761406844.0,2025-10-25,2025,10,Engaged with my dream ring and diamond!,"Well actually I've been engaged 4 months now, but I'm so in love with my ring I had to share it! 

A custom ring inspired by Roen NYC's Laguna solitaire - set high to accomodate a stack flush, with bright cut pave along the shoulders and shank and a hidden halo. I went with a thicker flat band (2.5mm) because that's my preference aesthetically. Seemingly simple with hidden sparkle that only I can see. 

The diamond is a 1.01ct elongated antique-style cushion, I colour VVS1. I love the glassy facets and the way it faces up bright but with a hint of warmth - old style diamonds are ridiculously charming to me, the modern brilliant cuts just don't move me the way these do! It also has great measurements for the carat weight - 7.24mmx5.98mm. 

I worked with a private jeweller who sourced the diamond for me. Initially I was set on a 2-2.5ct lab diamond, but this jeweller only works with naturals so I decided to go lower in carat size to be within an acceptable budget for my fiance. At first I regretted not just going for a larger lab, but honestly now I'm super happy I went for a smaller diamond because my finger is small (4.5) and I think this size is perfect on me. 

My fiance long knew I would design my own ring so he let me roll with it. Initially, his budget was S$4,000 because we thought I was going to go for a lab, but he was happy to more than double the budget so I could have my dream ring and stone :') 

I plan to get a channel set baguette half eternity wedding band to pair with this. The round channel set ring you see is one of my existing rings - having a wedding band esque ring really helped me understand what kind of setting would work for my ER! 

In short, I'm absolutely in love with it and I hope everyone feels the same way about your own rings! ",110,14,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ofuoqb

Recently, the stone has shifted and appears crooked, so I've stopped wearing it for now because losing the stone would be tragic! 

I am torn between getting it repaired or getting it reset. I would love this sub's advice, with these considerations in mind:

\- Is this setting simply too dainty for the shape and size of the stone? The setting has no donut or basket (side bars?), just the four single prongs coming up from the band. 

\- While I love the ring he got me, I'd previously always envisioned a simple solitaire (no pavé) engagement ring with a cathedral setting. So this could be an opportunity to redesign the setting to align with more with my tastes. 

\- That being said, I do like the ring and of course love the sentimental value of it being the ring my husband chose for me. If I can repair the current setting and and make it work, that would be a viable option. 

\- I'm also cost conscious, and don't have a good sense of repair vs. redesign costs. Not sure if the pavé diamonds could be traded in &amp; gold recycled for a redesign.

I want a natural mined elongated cushion with the ratio in the range of 1.2-1.5. I’m looking for something that’s 3 carats. 

I really want an old mine cut diamond but those are harder to find with decent color. I don’t mind going to an J color and SI1 maybe even SI2. I would also be happy with a regular cut cushion diamond but I would prefer an old mine cut. My budget is 20-22k including the setting so I am willing to compromise on some things to get what I’m looking for. 

The setting I want is a very simple solitaire platinum band - no frills at all. I don’t mind buying the diamond online and having it set with a local jeweler - but if that’s the case I’d want to spend about 20k on the diamond so I can spend the extra 2k on the setting. 

I’m also thinking about going to NYC diamond district to look so let me know your favorite stores there too!

I was looking at bestbrilliance .com because they have great pricing but I’ve heard the quality of mined diamonds is deceiving so I’m not confident purchasing from them.

I went to 2 different jewelers in the diamond district in Manhattan and asked them how much it would cost to add an oval lab grown diamond to the ring and also resize it smaller to fit my ring finger. The first jeweler told me it would be $3500 total and that he will “actually use my ring to do it”, and warned me that many jewelers will just cast a new ring because it’s easier. I asked him if it would be cheaper with a 1-1.5 carat diamond than 1.5-2 carat and he said only like 50 bucks cheaper. The second jeweler 2 doors down quoted me $1000 total, which seems like a ginormous price difference.

My boyfriend is going to ""officially"" propose soon with a ring, so looking for some guidance before we get designs made and a ring purchased. 

I always thought I wanted a radiant cut however I tried on an another ring I have which is oval and realised the shape suits me so much more than a more angular/rectangular shape. We are looking at moissanites as I feel uncomfortable with the idea of a natural diamond, and if we're going down the lab grown route then why not more affordable/more sparkles. I love a really sparkly/glittery stone so would appreciate any input specifically around that aspect and the cut for the stone, truthfully I'm not sure what options there are for oval. 

Below is a list/description of what I *think* I want:

Oval cut centre stone - 7x9mm  
10k white gold band - 2mm with half pave

I'm in the process of building a custom engagement ring and have narrowed it down to two labgrown radiant cut diamonds, both around 5 carats, F color, VVS2 clarity, excellent polish/symmetry, and both with similar dimensions.

The main difference is in their depth percentage:

Option A: 5.01ct | 11.52 x 8.63 x 5.71mm | 66.2% depth

Option B: 5.04ct | 11.50 x 8.56 x 5.83mm | 68.1% depth

I’m wondering; Will the extra 1.9% depth in Option B noticeably affect brilliance or face-up size? Or is that too small a difference to really matter? The price difference is about $1.1K, opton A being the more expensive one.

For context: The setting is a three-stone radiant ring with a diamond channel-set platinum band, so I want the center stone to shine, not get overshadowed.

Would love any gemologist or enthusiast input! 🙏

Unfortunately during shipment of the custom engagement ring I had made by a family friend got stolen out of the package (UPS next day air from FortWorth-Dallas area of Texas to Illinois (landed in Rockford) to Connecticut (2nd flight landed in the Hartford area)). Had it delivered to be picked up at my local UPS Store, and I arrived 30 minutes after the drop-off there to go pick it up. After opening it there to see the ring was missing, I realized I didn't have to cut any tape, the box opened right up. I noticed the tape looks cut on the box, so I feel I have my conclusion there.

I'm so irked beyond belief over this.

Here are pictures of the ring, the band is platinum, the 3 diamonds are lab grown, .75 ct center stone, .33 ct stones on either side. Size is 8. Luckily there's insurance for this but I do not want the person responsible for this to get off scott-free.

I’m planning to propose to my girlfriend next summer, and over the past few months I’ve been visiting several jewellers to look at loose marquise-cut natural diamonds. My inspiration has been the ring shown in the attached photo(the one on the hand)

Last month, I paused my search while I was changing jobs and had a lot going on. Now that I’ve settled into my new role, I decided to pick things back up and reached out to one of the jewellers I had previously spoken with to ask if they still had one of the diamonds I liked. To my surprise, the jeweller called me immediately and said that the ring was already being made and would be ready next week.

This left me quite confused, as our last conversation ended with her saying she would source a few more diamonds for me to compare. I never confirmed that I wanted to move forward, paid a deposit, agreed on a design, signed a contract, or even selected a diamond.

Today, she messaged me again to say that the ring is ready (photo attached with the white background). However, I’m not completely happy with the design, particularly the claws and the overall shape of the ring, as I had wanted a more defined wishbone/V shape like the reference image I originally shared during our consultation.

1onliic,labdiamond,natural vs lab,1762198418.0,2025-11-03,2025,11,LGG custom ring purchase review,"I recently arranged for a custom designed ring from LGG Jewelry and it arrived today. It was an excellent experience and I wanted to give a review for others that may be looking for a custom lab diamond ring. 

This ring is a 2ct G VS crushed ice oval lab diamond (no certificate) set in a 10k yellow gold bezel setting with a low profile tulip-inspired basket, cathedral shoulders, and milgrain detailing on the inside of the bezel. 

My rep, Romy, was very kind and responsive and helped me pick out the perfect diamond from their stock (much of which is available to see on their website) and nail down all of the details to be included in the design. She gave a price which included fees and shipping and I paid the full amount up front. The first CAD took about two days, and then after a couple very small tweaks, the second CAD arrived about a day later and looked good for production. 

Production took about a week and a half. I received a pre-shipment video, and after confirming that it looked as expected, it took about five days to get to me. The overall timeline seemed very quick for a custom piece - I first inquired about the ring on October 14th, and the ring was delivered November 3rd. The tariff fees were minimal. 

I'd gotten quotes from three doesn't overseas vendors and LGG had the best price, and they were very responsive and easy to work with to create exactly what I was looking for.   I will definitely work with LGG for future jewelry projects.

None of them hold any particular sentimental value for me, I don’t remember her wearing them or how/ when she received them,  other than they were once hers. My kids never met her and she passed when I was a teen. I don’t have many of her things and our relationship was strained due to her own demons and so I can have a tendency to romanticize her memory or  items that once belonged to her. 

This particular bracelet has been sitting in my jewelry box for almost 20 years. It’s not really my style, 40 something mom, but every so often I take it out and consider getting it resized. I also have a necklace with pendant that I’ll never wear and have been considering shortening the chain so I can use it.

My question is two fold:

1. How do we feel about resizing, changing these pieces? I wonder if there is value is leaving them as is for myself or my kids to see her style and size (like this ring once for grandmom so and so)? Or is this too sentimental?

2. How do we feel about this bracelet specifically, with my existing everyday stack? Keep? Resize? Save tucked away? Sell and buy something to create a new heirloom?

1onyojw,Diamonds,lab grown engagement,1762232165.0,2025-11-04,2025,11,Upgraded ring,"I got this ring for my 5 year anniversary. My original ring was just 1/2 ct diamonds with a morganite stone in the center and it got cloudy way to easily and I been wanting a diamond ring. So my husband let me pick one out. Got this one from Kay’s at 40 percent off. I have yet to see it in person as we were planning to move soon and those plans fell through, it is currently at my parents house hours away. This weekend I will be getting it. Anyway, at first I thought I wouldn’t need the life warranty plan as I didn’t think much damage could happen to it other than damage to the diamonds and that is already covered by the general warranty. How ever after talking to my aunt she said she’s had to pay to replace a broken prong and that’s something I never thought about. This new ring is a much higher setting than I am use to and much larger. Though my husband didn’t want to spend $700 for  the life time warranty plan. But now I am thinking that might be a wise add on, especially because this is a hefty ring and the cut seems like it will snag easily. I think I only have 30 days to add that before it’s too late (from time of purchase?) I also been having issues with my original ring making me get dry cracked and itchy skin after a short few hours of wearing it. It’s been 5 years since I’ve had it and I am currently pregnant. I don’t know if I am either all of a sudden getting an allergy to the metals in my 14k rose gold ring or if the e coating wore off and I’m allergic to other metals in the ring. Or maybe it simply had a build up of residue. Though it still irritates my skin even after a professional cleaning. I also sized up by half a size to have a tad extra room with the new ring, as my current ring is a size 7. Thought please? Thank you!! ",5,4,0.85,https://i.redd.it/nfk9zxgz86zf1.jpeg

For context - my fiancée has wanted one for years and I want to surprise her for Christmas. She also knows her stuff and used to work at a jewelry store. She’s previously tried some on with me (when we were trying on engagement rings) and would make comments like “the diamonds here are too far apart” or “the bracelet uses extra metal to make the diamonds seem bigger than they are.”

Anyone know where I should be looking? I was initially looking at Costco since it seemed to tick the right boxes but they seem to only sell 7 in. bracelets and her wrist is smaller. Someone I know who bought a ring from Brilliant Earth has been having quality issues so I’ve been avoiding them. Looking for something:

- any carat size

1oq5avd,labdiamond,natural diamond,1762450468.0,2025-11-06,2025,11,Role of moissanite/sapphire in a world of lab diamonds,"Recently I bought 2 colored lab diamonds and was comparing them to moissanite/colored sapphire at the same time for pricing. The moissanite was about $400 less than the diamond. Which made me ask, why are people buying moissanite/colored sapphires when colored diamonds are only a few hundred more? 

When lab diamonds were closer to the price of natural diamonds, then it made much more sense to get other gemstones as you were saving thousands. But now that lab diamonds are so much closer to the price of other gemstones, are any of you buying moissanite or sapphires? Does it make sense to when you can get a diamond and just save up for another month?

I get that $400 is $400 and that may be too much, or maybe for that one piece of jewelry you really don’t need a diamond. But even for a “fun” piece of jewelry (not something for a wedding/anniversary), I find myself saying “why wear a sapphire when I could just buy a diamond?” But then again I love diamonds more than any other stone.

I’d love to know your thoughts and see if there’s something I’m missing!",0,32,0.47,https://www.reddit.com/r/labdiamond/comments/1oq5avd/role_of_moissanitesapphire_in_a_world_of_lab/

We picked out an oval, lab grown diamond for the ring—it’s a much warmer diamond (I color) and was harder to find in a reasonable price range because of that reason. 

Two days after we picked up the ring, I noticed a small chip in the side right below the girdle. It is noticeable to the naked eye and I can feel it with my fingernail. This mark was not indicated as an inclusion on the diamond diagram. 

Our jeweler is offering to swap out the chipped diamond for a new one or giving us money back if we choose to keep the original diamond as is. The jeweler said re-cutting the stone is probably not a good idea since we’d lose about 20%. 

I love the stone so much and am sad to think about not having it, especially if we can’t find another diamond like it. I also want my ring to last a lifetime. 

What do you recommend I do?

I got engaged a few months ago, and while I’m so happy with my ring and my fiancé, I’ve recently gone down a rabbit hole about my diamond and I can’t tell what cut I actually have.

I also shared a list of specific qualities I wanted, and one of them was an old euro cut diamond instead of a modern brilliant. 

I know my fiancé custom designed the ring with a jeweler and it’s a lab grown diamond (which I wanted/expected in the first place). He said they incorporated everything I wanted. I’ve tried asking him for the specifics, but I don’t want to push for anything because I don’t want him to think I’m having second thoughts about the ring, because I really do love it!

I told him I wanted a three stone teal sapphire ring and he found this STUNNING bicolor sapphire from Natural Sapphire Co that was dark blue in the middle and a light teal on the outside. It looks like an ""eye"" from straight on, but from even the slightest angle it makes the most gorgeous gradient that captures all the colors of the ocean. I am constantly turning it and staring at it. The cut is gorgeous, the way it sparkles and shows off the color is gorgeous. I'm beyond obsessed.

It was a bit of a journey to get the stone set in a way that we liked. Initially the stone was set VERY high which was awesome because it showed off the ""eye"" the clearest, but there were huge gaps between the center and side stones that drove me nuts.

I probably ended up spending $500 over the course of a year and a half swapping heads and making tweaks to the setting until we ended up where we are now, with no gaps between the side stones and the center stone. The ""eye"" appearance is more subtle now but the gradient in color was my favorite feature anyway. It's absolutely perfect the way it is now, and was worth the effort to get where we ended up &lt;3

1or4mnp,labdiamond,mined diamond,1762545678.0,2025-11-07,2025,11,Comprehensive Guide to quotes from overseas vendors for custom cut Old Mine Cut Diamond,"I thought it might be helpful to others looking for specific custom cut lab diamonds to know an extremely comprehensive list of quotes and notes from various vendors. For background information, back in February I saw a diamond ring I fell absolutely head over heels in love with. It was listed with Andria Barbone for $75,000 and is now sold but I will attach the link in the comments for those interested. i will also post pictures in the comments of the examples I sent to vendors. The specifications I gave each vendor is this: ""My specifications are that it be an elongated antique brilliant cushion old mine cut with a pinhole culet. I want the size to be around 9x11mm (around 4 carats). Color GHI and VS. Elongated ratio of about 1.2."" Some of the vendors I asked for a 10x8 quote from because I originally wanted that but then decided it was too small. What I am looking for is very close to the August Vintage Old Mine Brilliant Cut from Distinctive Gems, but elongated. I asked each vendor for videos proving that they could produce what I was asking for. So far, I have not made a purchase yet. I am unsure who I will be purchasing from, but I am leaning towards purchasing from u/shelikessparkles or u/weezie_jefferson. They understand what I am looking for and are willing to help with a custom cut, but we are likely waiting for tariff prices to be reduced from India. They recently sold a few diamonds that were extremely close to what I am looking for, but not elongated. For your reference, they were just over 4 carats at around $2200 because of high tariff prices. I am hoping to be less than $1500. Distinctive Gem has the diamonds listed on their site for $11,000 for a 4 carat lab diamond.   
Language has proved to be somewhat of an issue, as a lot of vendors have sent me bar culets but not pinhole culets. It seems the biggest issue in having this custom cut is the fact that I want a pinhole culet and the actual cut of the diamond is difficult to cut. Most of these quotes were from Alibaba or through finding the vendors phone number and contacting on Whatsapp.

Based on my conversation with Matthew, 6.5"" length is the best fit for my wife's wrists (which are 6"" circumference just past that bone on the side of the wrist). So adding an allowance of 0.5"" will make it so that there's still a bit of allowance for adjustment in the future.

On the other hand, the price from IDJ is very attractive and the piece looks amazing too. But of course it has smaller stones. And since this is a bit too long at 7"", adjusting it will mean removal of stones which makes it less cttw when worn.

1ota0d9,EngagementRings,natural diamond,1762769278.0,2025-11-10,2025,11,Got upgraded to wife (and upgraded the ring too while we were at it!),"Exactly one year ago, my now husband proposed with a very simple alexandrite ring set in sterling silver (it was intended to be a promise ring, and then we decided we were ready to actually just commit). We have matching necklaces that I made us after the eclipse in 2024 with ""Alexandrite"" (neodymium) glass beads that change color so the stone is meaningful to us in that way. At our wedding, I even handmade all of our jewelry (aside from the rings) and used vintage Swarovski alexandrite crystals to call back to that significance (but that's a story for another sub! ;P) 

We sat down together to select the ring I'd ""upgrade"" to at our wedding, which we celebrated last month, so I can finally show off the ring! We had a very intimate wedding in Copenhagen with our immediate family, and in April 2026, we'll be doing it again stateside for all my family and friends who couldn't travel to Europe! We plan to add a simple wedding band onto it then! 

We settled on a 14k rose gold ""Briar Rose"" setting from Oore Jewelry with a 5x7 Alexandrite in the center, Alexandrite side stones, and natural diamond accents! What amazes me is how truly low set this ring is! It doesn't snag or catch on any of my clothes and it's dainty without feeling delicate. I love everything about it! 

I've also included several photos of the ring in different lights so you can really see the spectacular color shifts of the alexandrites. A lot of those pictures were taken on the same day literally moments apart from one another! 

I even included a photo of how it fluoresces under a 365nm blacklight I collect uranium glass and other fluorescent antique glassware, so I think this is pretty darn neat!

All in all, I could not be happier with my ring and if you're on the fence about ordering from Oore jewelry, know that Uma will make the ring of your dreams come true! She was so easy to work with and communicative at every step of the way and my ring even came much sooner than anticipated! ",115,15,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ota0d9

1otum4a,labdiamond,lab grown engagement,1762819798.0,2025-11-11,2025,11,Received my upgrade!,"My wedding was in 2022. When we moved in 2024, my ring got lost somehow in our move. I recently decided to upgrade my ring and build something with a lab grown. I had a few lab rep reach out on here, but at the end of the day it came to vendors and reviews I heard about in these subs. One of the biggest selling features of this company was that they would have the ring on my hand by October 16-23 range and I was excited for it to make my birthday event. 

I saw several good reviews on Daniel Williams so I gave them a look. Their inventory was great and gold prices reasonable so after a lot of research I went for it with a 2.71 E VVS1/2 (I forget which) six prong solitaire.

The stone ended up being unavailable (after purchase) which put me on edge and made me nervous. They asked me to select a new diamond. I vocalized my unease, and they were super professional and reassuring. I selected a new diamond which was a 3.06 with the same or better specs, and they covered the additional cost, which was really gracious and customer service forward. . I went back and forth with them on size, and width of band. I ended up increasing it to 3mm. I want to notate that I had a LOT of back and forth requests, and they were really patient and responsive. 

After choosing the new stone, the stone I chose ended up getting stuck for an entire month in customs due to the government shut down. This was *sooo* frustrating for me and I started to grow antsy (we were about 5 weeks in at this point from order date). They told me the fastest way to solve this would be for me to select a new diamond (yes, a third) within the US. I started to browse and found one I loved — in the USA, 3.02, E VS1. The price was again higher and they honored this with ease. My stone made it to them on Tuesday, and my ring was on my hand Friday! 

The photos and video of this ring do not do it ANY justice, and I mean that. The craftsmanship of this band, prongs, and setting are truly some of the best I’ve seen. I feel so secure even wearing to work. I cannot recommend DWD more. They were so professional, handled all of my requests and questions with grace and patience, covered additional costs and gave me a far better diamond than I’d paid for. They also overnighted my package. I will definitely
Refer my friends to them and shop there in future for future jewelry needs.

My budget can go up to $8,000, and the setting is already $2,700, which leaves me $4k+ for the center stone. We also like 2.5 ct and above.

There's so many options so I'm a little overwhelmed, but I chose the below from the same boutique shop we visited that had the 3 settings we liked.

What do we think of the below two options or are there any others I should consider from the website? Are these prices standard for lab grown?

Super happy with everything. Jason was incredibly patient and kind to work with. This was my first time ordering from an overseas vendor, and first time ordering a lab diamond piece in general. 

I reached out to Jason on 9/23 asking about the custom order. He was quick to respond with a quote and a diamond that matched my desired specs. Payment was easy through Alibaba. There was a Chinese holiday from Oct 1-6 which slowed the process, but wasn’t an issue overall for me. I received the CAD on 10/17. I had done quite a bit of research beforehand so my initial inquiry included a lot of detail, which made the rest of the process pretty smooth. The CAD was exactly what I pictured. 

The diamond itself arrived to Jason around 10/27 which is when he sent me more detailed videos/pictures of it to confirm. It was absolutely gorgeous, but I did still seek second opinions just because I have never shopped for diamonds before. Second opinions confirmed it looked good 🙂 After that, Jason reached out on 11/3 with final pictures of the ring - it was ready to ship! It looked even more beautiful than I imagined. The price he initially quoted me included shipping, but I did have to pay import fees (around $30) while it was being shipped. I received the ring at my doorstep on 11/7. 

So overall, under 7 weeks total. I am so happy with how the ring turned out. It’s so beautiful in person and the quality is amazing. I had no issues with the entire process. Jason was patient with me when I had questions and explained things thoroughly even though the language barrier occasionally made that tricky. But overall, I would absolutely recommend!

I just received the ring and it is stunning. What I wasn’t ready for - was just how massive it looks on hand 😂 i think it will take some getting used to, but very happy nonetheless.

Because I had asked for it to be low profile, my existing diamond wedding band does not fit well with it where the bottom of the emerald cut diamond rubs against the top of the diamond band.

Any suggestions on what band I should wear with it? Add a spacer? A curved wedding diamond band? Or no band?

Backstory:

My wife and I are coming up on our 10-year anniversary and I’m upgrading her engagement ring. I want something really special, and she loves big, super-sparkly stones. I’m looking at lab-grown so I can go larger and higher quality without going totally insane on price. Found this 4.02ct, but I’d love to hear what you all think before I pull the trigger. I don't mind going bigger if you guys think there is something available.

Crazy how much prices have changed. 10 years ago, I paid $25k+ for a subpar 2.3ct.   


Here are the specs:

Is D/VVS1  overkill for lab? Since it’s an anniversary upgrade I figured why not go for the nicest thing I can. What do you think of the cut angles and the overall proportions? Anything jump out as a red flag? Would you buy this? Cost?

I wanted to post a review of Starsgem as a first time buyer. 

I’ve bought 4 items:
- 1ct pear lab diamond pinky ring, 10k yellow gold 
- 1ct round lab diamond ring with starbursts and additional diamonds on the band, 14k yellow gold
- 5.23ctw lite gold tennis bracelet with 2.8mm lab diamonds, 10k yellow gold + safety chain
- lab diamond pavé paper clip bracelet, 10k yellow gold 

The rep I work with is Demi. She communicates clearly and is very nice. I will say, I intentionally try to stay up late or wake up early if I have questions for her or want an update on production of the pieces. I’ve found her to be quick to quote pieces I’m interested in and find her prices to be on the cheaper end compared to other overseas vendors. 

I sought out overseas vendors as my boyfriend and I are discussing engagement rings and I wanted to see quality of some of the recommended vendors I see commonly mentioned on here and on other subreddits before deciding on who to create a custom ring with. 

All pieces were produced fairly quickly and shipping was via DHL. I bought the two rings within a few days of each other and the bracelets the same day. Demi let me combine shipping so I didn’t have to pay for it multiple times, which I appreciate! 

I wear the rings everyday. I got the pinky ring too large by mistake so I plan to have it resized. The round diamond ring is super sparkly and beautiful (I’m not even that big of a fan of round diamonds!). The tennis bracelet is very light on the wrist and I definitely see value in the safety chain. I got a size 7 to allow for me to resize down and have spare diamonds in case any come loose over time. The paperclip pavé is beautiful but the clasp is very tricky and I’m trying to learn how to make it easier to undo. 

All in all - I love all of my pieces. Demi has been great to work with. My boyfriend plans to gift me some earrings for Christmas and we plan to purchase them through her! ",135,91,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1owaojc

Here’s where I’m confused though…Aren’t these basically old diamonds from random people who died??? I’m not trying to be rude, but I don’t get the appeal. Wouldn’t it make more sense to buy a new diamond that’s cut in an old mine style? Wouldn’t it be cheaper, better looking, and fresh.

I’m also noticing that Andria Barbone seems to charge a decent markup just because a stone is antique. Are these actually worth it? Is there something special about these stones that I’m missing? Why would someone want an older ring instead of a brand new one?

1oxm0h6,EngagementRings,natural diamond,1763193396.0,2025-11-15,2025,11,My full engagement ring buying experience and lessons learned,"Hello everyone! As a very excited new fiancée, I wanted to share my ring buying experience and everything I learned in the process because it was it was SO overwhelming at the start, and I'm hoping this will either answer some questions or give people some food for thought to research themselves, because I didn't even know some of these things existed before starting!

The tl;dr on the ring first:

We went with the [Ari from Cullen Jewellery](https://cullenjewellery.com/en-au/engagement-rings/ring-ari/melee-stones:lab-diamond+metal-type:18k-yellow-gold), a radiant solitaire with a hidden halo and cathedral setting

* Metal: 2-toned (18k yellow gold with platinum prongs)
* Band width: 2mm band tapered
* Carat: 2.01ct lab diamond
* Colour: D
* Clarity: VVS2 clarity
* Ratio: 1.41
* Ring Size: N 1/2 AUS (7 US)

 

Setting

* I chose a high-set ring, mainly because I wanted a wedding band to sit flush underneath the stone and not have to worry about going for something curved or custom fit
* I wanted a cathedral (the two support arches on the sides), as I was uncomfortable with a big rock being supported by only one point of contact with the band, and the cathedral didn't add any extra height
* I wanted a gallery rail (the horizontal band around and underneath) to help support the stone - the added diamonds (to make it a hidden halo) were just an added bonus!
* I was happy with Ari's default 2mm band! I didn't want it getting too thin over time
* You can go with all sorts of claw settings (single, double, triple, or even round or square or bezel!), but I was happy with a single claw! I looked at one double but thought it was too busy

 

Carat

* This is totally personal preference, and different stone shapes hold weight differently! I try my mum's 2ct round on, and it feels ridiculous on my finger. However, a 2ct radiant felt perfect! I've attached a pic of some different carats (2.4, 1.75 and 1.5, the latter two in temporary settings). There's also a pic of different carats in different ratios (more on that further down). Totally recommend just getting in and trying different sizes and see how they fit on your finger
* \~2 felt like the best balance for me!

 

Colour

* I was targeting the colourless range (D, E, F), but after looking at multiple loose stones, I could start to tell it had a little more warmth when it hit F
* Because I wanted something as icy white as possible, I chose to set the prongs in platinum. I'm a yellow gold girly, but I looked at several diamonds set in both yellow gold and white gold/platinum. Being set in yellow-gold introduced a lot of warmth in the stone. These are still absolutely beautiful - it's just entirely personal preference! There was no sense in me spending on a D or E colourless stone if I was going to add warmth back into the diamond by setting it in yellow-gold
* White gold is alloyed to look that way and can dull/yellow overtime, while platinum is naturally white. White gold is often plated with rhodium to keep it looking so white, and needs to be redone regularly.  Therefore, I chose platinum
* From the top down, the claws blend in nicely with the diamond and helps it POP when contrasted against the yellow gold

 

Clarity

* Radiant diamonds hide inclusions really well because they have that ""crushed ice"" look and have SO many facets, so I was open to dropping to VS1/VS2. I was shown a range of VVS against VS and couldn't tell the difference.

 

Ratio

* I've attached a pic of different ratio stones I looked at (2.4ct with a 1.3 ratio, and a 2.2ct with a 1.44 ratio). I ended up preferring a more elongated (larger) ratio based on how it sat on my finger
* I thought I was noticing that the more elongated you go, the higher the risk of getting a bow-tie. This is a darker ""bow-tie"" shape in the middle of the stone, so I tried to find a balance between a longer shape without getting that bow-tie

 

Cut

* There's no formal ""cut"" grade for anything other than a round. I was given an ideal table (60 - 69) and depth (60 - 67) % to look for (which you can find on the diamond certificate), but there are so many different faceting patterns that you can't read off the diamond certificate
* By this point, after narrowing down the rest of my ideal parameters (colour, ratios, etc.), I was mainly looking at visual differences!

 

Buying experience

* I went into ring shopping with ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE on what I wanted. I had some pinned as inspo, but they were all incredibly different styles. Cullen Jewellery kept popping up on my explore pages, so I booked a consultation just to start trying things on and see what I liked on my finger. I guess I was kind of lucky that my decision was made for me because as soon as I tried on a radiant cut I FELL IN LOVE and hyperfocused down on it.
* The sales consultant we had was absolutely lovely and SO knowledgeable. They let me try on as many rings as I wanted, and then when I started narrowing down on a radiant, she pulled out various colours, ratios and carat sizes to compare. Basically all the information from above was taught to me by Cullen either in my consultation, or from all the educational content they post on their socials afterwards. These reels were game changing!!
* I wasn't pressured at all to make a purchase, so we left feeling more equipped with knowledge to do some research and comparisons. Everything they taught us was SUCH a huge help to start looking at comparisons
* I only went into one other jeweller in-person after this, who sold both lab and mined diamonds. This was still helpful to compare more loose radiant diamonds against each other but the prices were far more inflated!! I later found out that places that sell both mined and lab will markup lab even more, to nudge you towards a ""oh, well if you pay just a liiitttle more you can get a NATURAL"". I also asked them to list off diamond prices for me - the SECOND you round over a 2.0ct they added about $1000 to the price. I asked them if it was a marketing tactic because ""2.0 sounds better than 1.9 even though the naked eye can't tell the difference"", and he sheepishly said ""well we're not supposed to admit that""!!
* After browsing similar settings and stones compared to Cullen (who I had been pestering with more questions this whole time, and were so responsive and helpful with their answers), I enjoyed my experience with them so much that we decided to go back to them for a second (and final) consultation. They have really good images of the diamonds on their website, but the biggest hesitation I had in this whole process was picking the ""final"" diamond without seeing it in person. The consultation was basically an hour of me playing with the filters on their diamonds (e.g. colour, ratio, etc.) and the sales consultant pointing out which were cut better and why. It was so helpful having an expert to point out the faceting patterns, where hidden shadows were hiding, why one cut was better than the other, etc., and she did such a good job that I felt confident going ahead
* In the end, we had narrowed it down to 4 diamonds that I was happy with, and my fiancé picked the final one!

 

Overall, I'm so SO happy with my ring. It's absolutely perfect to me. Huge shoutout to Cullen Jewellery for all the help (i.e. putting up with my constant barrage of questions) and excellent customer service along the way. Highly recommend :)",67,15,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxm0h6

The price was way below what I expected (under $1300), there was no video, and it has strong blue fluorescence.

1oxzijn,EngagementRings,mined diamond,1763232449.0,2025-11-15,2025,11,Help pick - Pear solitaire with a bigger stone or 3-stone with smaller center stone?,"Hi Everyone -

Fiancee Needs Your Help.



She doesn't have a Reddit account, so we are leveraging mine. She is torn between the two stack options below. The cut (Ideal), color (D), and clarity (IF) will be the same for the two engagement rings center stone. The only difference between the two will be the carats. All rings will be platinum.

Option 1 - 6.5 carat solitaire stacked with a plain wedding band. What she loves about the solitaire is being able to admire the center stone as it will be an engineering marvel in her mind...pear nova (proprietary cut). She's already wanting to call it her ""diamond nuggy"" (nugget).

Option 2 - 5.8 carat center stone with side baguettes with a plain wedding band. What she loves about the three stone engagement is that it fits her style, simple, classic, timeless, and elegant...but smaller center stone.

Here's what they look like:

Scale wax models (ignore the ""two pears"" one, we ruled it out):

https://preview.redd.it/qe7kv5x6vg1g1.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56ddff57e17c3fba59f1b508c6d1fb467ef07fec

  


Note, the plain wedding bands are sentimental as we will be doing a workshop making each others' wedding band. And the wax rings are to scale. The pear nova is a deep cut. So, the face up is smaller than a standard pear cut. So the 6.5 vs. 5.8 carats is a mm different face up. Both are about a 4 carat face up width and length. No one would know that she would have these two carat size options...but she will know...and I think that will eat her up inside a little...a little regret. Hopefully, that will go away when she has the ring and that sparkle will blind her into forgetting.

Overall, she is conflicted because she loves the three stone ring but would rather leverage our budget to get the biggest stone she can as this is a once in a lifetime purchase. She figures we can always redo the engagement ring to include the baguettes for one of the bigger anniversaries...but more difficult to buy another larger stone.

Personally, I want her to have her dream ring. Either option will be great and super sparkly.  She's just stuck between these two options.

Helllo! My partner and I are genuinely seeking advice on this stone our jeweler showed us recently. We are ring shopping and found a jeweler we know we want to work with for creating our bespoke engagement ring! We are sourcing diamonds with her now. We would love insight on the proportions of the cut...as pear diamonds do not get a cut grading. 

Also, what are people's thoughts on bow tie effects? This diamond is in between a standard to minimal bow tie effect. I can try to provide a video for more feedback.

Given the color grade and clarity grade, the diamond is in the $30k bracket. What do you think of the price? Would you negotiate? Can you negotiate when buying diamonds? The jeweler we are working with is a small business run by a beautiful couple. 

We are going for a two-tone band. 18K yellow gold band and will get platinum for basket and prongs to appreciate the colorless diamond. We are going for a low setting and pear will be set horizontally (east west). 

For prongs, would you go for 3 prongs or 5 prongs? The 3 prongs give a minimal look while the 5 prongs seem to engulf the diamond in my opinion...but I see value in getting a 5 prong versus a 3 prong setting to secure the diamond from daily wear. 

Our ideal carat size is 1.8 to represent the number 18 that holds significance to us. This is a 1.9ct with the thought of 9 minus 1 to equal an 8.

- minimum F colour 

- minimum VVS2 clarity

- I’m looking for a super ideal cut, and I want to place the most importance on this C




In regards to the vendors I’m looking at 77 diamonds specifically as they have a store in Paris and to be honest I feel more comfortable making a large purchase with a vendor that I can actually visit in a store if there is an issue. However I have also been looking at the Brian Gavin black collection, and whilst this seems to guarantee a better cut this would be entirely online. 




How reliable is Gavin Black ? Does anyone in Europe have experience with them ? Once I receive the diamond, how can I verify it is actually what I have paid for ? Are there any other very reputable vendors I should be looking at ? And I guess any general pointers on purchasing diamonds entirely online ?

I recently got engaged on the top of Namsan Tower in Korea 🥰. Prior to the trip, my bf and I did a TON of research on different lab grown diamond retailers. After Reddit testimonies etc, we ultimately went with loose grown diamond (lgd). 

While yes, I absolutely adore my ring - i wish I would’ve chosen else where, and here’s why⤵️:

When ordering and designing my ring we took into account the diamond quality itself, price and the turn around time. One of the MAIN reasons we went with lgd was because it would’ve gotten here plenty early for the trip (I figured out the secret way early so I was a part of the process).

This was around three months prior to us leaving, and according to lgd, it would’ve gotten here with ample time between our departure date. So I chose the main diamond, specs etc and had placed the order. Yay! Right? No, it was crickets after that. After about a week and a half my fiance was mentioned he hadn’t heard a single update. I reached out to customer service and they said it was because I hadn’t approved the cad design they sent via email following the order. Confused as they have you approve card when you order as well, I followed up and mentioned we had never received the email (I scoured our inboxes first). The agent then proceeded to tell me they did and that I should check my spam folder etc. again I confirmed that we did not and they argued further before sending them to me - which was the exact photos they had me already confirm when checking out. Once that was done I said okay I want to make sure this will get here by this date. They said oh yes don’t worry it will be done in time, here’s the delivery date and timeline. 

Then it was crickets again. I continued to follow up with customer service, which was returned with excuses each time. like how the cad is now awaiting approval (for two weeks and this wasn’t a custom design it’s one on their website) from the ring maker. Finally, it was approved. again I followed up mentioning they were getting close to the departure date. They then said that for the troubles they would expedite the process at no cost. Okay cool, what a relief. Also wrong. The date is approaching faster and faster and the updates are few and far between. I am in contact with customer service weekly at this point and am constantly reassured that it will get here in time. 

Welp, it didn’t. We left for our trip and had to use a $7 kohls ring as a place holder. I cried. Sounds pretty dumb but I was more upset that the photos we were taking while we were there wouldn’t have the real ring and this was a once in a lifetime experience.

Once we got back three weeks later, we noticed it don’t fit. Which was weird because I was professionally sized three times before we placed the order. Their website states resizing is only allowed within 7 days which obviously wasn’t possible for us as we were out of the country. I reached out to see if they would make an exception due to the circumstances and they said sure they will waive partial fees resulting is having to pay $75 instead of $100. I argued but ultimately gave up due to our frustration and annoyance with this whole process. We got it resized locally - they also noted that it was not the size I ordered - we even double checked the receipts. 

Now all is well and like I said I am so happy with it but I would NOT recommend them based on our experience. I know it was long but I wanted to provide a real, recent testimony for those who are looking for a retailer for their diamonds. 

Hope this helps :) ",65,19,0.95,https://i.redd.it/jp535uxbwr1g1.jpeg

Proportion Guidelines I’ve Gathered •	Table: 58–64% •	Depth: 61–67% •	Crown: 12–14% (≈33–37°) •	Pavilion: 47–53% (≈30–34°) •	Girdle: Medium–Slightly Thick (2–5%) •	Culet: None

My Main Confusion

From what I understand, true Crisscut stones are certified/owned by Christopher Designs. However, when I reach out to jewelers (some recommended through this subreddit), they tell me they can source lab-grown Crisscuts—yet the IGI certificates they send me all say things like “cut-cornered rectangular mixed cut.”

Is that actually what a lab-grown Crisscut is supposed to be labeled as? Are these legitimate Crisscut cuts and IGI just doesn’t classify them by branded cut? Or are these likely cushion/emerald hybrids that aren’t Crisscuts?

I’m trying to make sure I’m not being shown standard mixed cuts when I’m specifically looking for the Crisscut pattern.

If anyone has experience with Crisscuts (natural or lab-grown), knows what they should look like on a certificate, or has tips on what I should be asking jewelers to verify, I would seriously appreciate the guidance.

1ozowqb,Diamonds,natural diamond,1763405863.0,2025-11-17,2025,11,Yellow lab vs natural diamond?,"Hi! Would love some opinions here. 

I'm in the process of buying a ring for my partner (yay!) and she wants a yellow diamond. She wanted something that looked ""unconventional but still like an engagement ring"". 

We tried on some warm old mined stones (NOT yellow) and she liked those as well. My sense is that she likes lighter yellow stones, NOT the super intensely saturated yellows. 

I'm working with a jeweller and she said that its very difficult to find a light yellow lab. The lightest we found is still pretty saturated. 

My partner and I had talked about price and she feels (maybe even stronger than me) that lab is preferable from a $$ perspective and because she doesn't care about the ring being natural. I think the ring she gets me (we're lesbians) will probably be a lab diamond and \~$5-10k total.

[Lab on top, natural on bottom in the circle](https://preview.redd.it/oypb8hfc6v1g1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fb005ee5ef4dfb11a5f1ad2f59c41f60d17d950)

The problem is, I much preferred the light yellow stone that I saw today at the jeweller. The lab yellow diamond seems soooo saturated to me and looks ""fake"". But theres a massive price difference and I don't know if my gf will feel the same way (about the difference in color being worth that much more $$). The lab is $5k and the natural is $15k. That would bring the overall ring cost to \~8k and 20k, respectively. 

I can afford it, but I just don't know if its worth it to my partner. Without directly asking her (or do you think I should do that?) what do you think?

1ozshyb,EngagementRings,natural diamond,1763413877.0,2025-11-17,2025,11,I need advice,"I have been engaged for about a month. My partner and I went to look at rings together and ultimately ended up designing my ring together. I picked a secondhand thicker gold band and we ended up picking a natural stone. I sat on it and decided I wanted a lab diamond as the cost was just giving me a bad taste. I went back to the shop alone and decided on two stones so he could choose to offer some element of surprise as well as pick a cost that better suited his budget. (I got pregnant between the first and second appointment so our priorities shifted). I looked at a 2 and a 3 carrot radiant cut lab diamond. Both super warm, almost yellow which I was clear about in both appointments, I wanted a warm tone diamond. I also voiced I wanted a more square shaped diamond. Still elongated but not full on rectangle.

Fast forward to October. My partner made plans to propose on a trip we had planned and obviously needed the ring beforehand and I believe it was ready a week or two out. She had mentioned the diamonds I had originally looked at were no longer available and they worked out a deal on another. I think my partner was solely focused on the proposal and getting antsy that it was close to the trip to really notice but the diamond I got is almost colorless and full on rectangle. I was specific to my jeweler that I wanted warm warm and I wasn’t super picky about clarity. My partner and I were looking at wedding band inspo online last night and we couldn’t remember my ring size so I suggested maybe it’s on the paperwork from when he purchased the ring. That’s when we realized that my diamond is almost colorless and he finally noticed and I finally admitted to myself it wasn’t the color diamond I wanted.

The ring is stunning and I feel so lucky to have it. At the end of the day it’s not about the ring but I just feel like this shop was pushy for a natural diamond which is why we went that route originally and then wanted to do things their way once we went lab. I feel like I wasn’t listened to and money was spent on something I didn’t ask for. I’m grateful and don’t want to seem like a brat but I almost feel like they took advantage of what we were wanting. I went back and forth on design a bit so maybe I was being difficult but I don’t wear jewelry and I wanted it to be exactly what I was envisioning since it’s not a cheap purchase.

My partner realizing it made me feel like the door was open to bring it up to him but I feel bad complaining when the ring I have is so stunning. 

The first pic is my current ring 3.2 carat and the second is the color diamond from the shop which is 2 carat. I liked another one that looked like that but it was 3 carat. My current ring is color H and at the shop I was looking at colors J and K.

What should I do?

I'm not an expert, so forgive me if I use the wrong terminology, but here are the things I'm looking for: 

Color- I would like a slightly off white or warm white color. I don't like the almost colorless grey look like the typical diamond 

Shape / cut - I want a marquise shape with a rose cut. I also really want it to be more long and thin than short and wide. 

Carat - I don't want tiny but I don't want huge. I tend to like the 1.5 - 2.5 range. 

Price - technically we're looking to spend under 4,000 for the entire ring, but I don't feel like that will happen. I think we could compromise for the perfect diamond.

Lab / natural - I don't mind either way, but I was leaning towards lab for our budget.

I understand gold is a popular option but as a Muslim man, I'm not permitted to wear gold. That leaves just silver and I don't care much to have something in my mouth that is prone to tarnishing. Of course I can always polish silver but that's a hassle. Unless there are other materials Grillz are made of, that leaves me with just platinum. Through a conversation I had with the company I mentioned, they informed me that platinum is heavy in comparison to gold &amp; silver. Would the extra weight of platinum be an issue or is it negligible? Another question I have is who makes the best platinum Grillz? Platinum Grillz seem to be especially niche.

1. The white gold and diamond kinda blend into each other resulting in low contrast and it feels like it's just blending in my skin. I usually wear silver but I'm kinda rethinking it.

2. Maybe I'm just not used to wearing rings,  but the ring keeps slanting and turning (not shown in picture). I tried smaller sizes but they can't get through my joint. I have another ring that wraps around your finger so it's easier to adjust the circumference and I've had no problems with it. Does that even exist for engagement rings?

Starting to look for an engagement ring and it was ""heavily suggested"" I look for an oval cut with a hidden halo setting.

-With oval shaped stones so is there an noticeable difference when comparing carat sizes?

-are there different grades of lab grown?

-what are the more reputable brands/stores/etc?

-is it better to buy the stone and setting separately?

So, I have a three stone diamond ring (natural stones) no idea about cut, clarity, or anything else. All three stones fluoresce slightly differently, but one is a beast under uv. Not only does it fluoresce, but it also displays phosphorescence after the uv is turned off (in the dark, cant be seen in light! 

The glow continues for a good 3 minutes after the uv is removed, although as time passes it gets more faint until its not glowing anymore. 

The middle stone has an inclusion across the middle of the stone, which seems to keep the fluorescence to the edges, and a few spots in the middle.

Can anyone explain why this happens? I am absolutely fascinated by both the fluorescence and the phosphorescence, but having extensively googled I'm not 100% certain about the reasoning - something to do with the nitrogen and boron in the stone, from my understanding - but I would love to know more as this sent me on a goose chase looking at every single stone in my and my family's jewellery, looking for more fluorescent stones, of which there are several. None phosphoresce though, apart from the brightest stone in these images.

My ring also leans, with the tip pointing up even higher, as the band itself is placed quite low on the ring. 

Is this a poorly made setting, or is it just the nature of a pave band with a 3 carat pear? 

I think that I would like to request that these issues be fixed within my 30 day window, but I am unsure exactly what to say/request in this case? There doesnt appear to be much room to lower the diamond, especially the bottom half.

This diamond is somehow 50-75% less than similar diamonds from other jewellers I’ve looked at with similar specs. 

The jeweller inherited a jewelry business, is retired, and doesn’t add much of a markup, but I would have assumed the suppliers are the same. 

Is there a reason why this would be so much cheaper?

Should I be concerned about the “bow tie effect” you can see in the image?

In looking for the future, I had found a couple of cuts of diamonds that seemed particularly appealing, but which I can find almost no information on. Most notably, I've been drawn to floral designs like the Sakura Cut offered by a few companies, or ShaneCo's Padma cut, but don't live close enough to any of these sellers to see them in person and how they really compare to traditional cuts in the same shape. For those who have had experience with these kinds of diamonds, I had a few questions: 



Do these diamonds show up as nice as they do digitally? Is there really that notable of a difference in the long term?


Are there concerns I should be paying attention to in regards to the 4Cs with specialty cuts like these that are different from normal round/cushion cuts? 


Are there special considerations I should have to make sure they shine best in an engagement ring? 


Some examples of what I am talking about are below. Thanks in advance for your help!

Initially I wanted and sought out an elongated old mine diamond, which is what we bought (pictures of diamond and GIA cert attached). We’ve been working with a jeweler to create a similar E/W design to “Inspo #1” (whose dimensions with the gold half-bezel are 10.5 W x 8.6 L x 8.43 millimeters). 

Now that it’s been mocked up in CAD (see “Mock-up #1 and #2”), I’m not sure it looks good, and I’m worried it is too elongated. (Important to note that the finished product will look a little different when the bezels fold over and cover a bit of the diamond on each side).  

I’m hoping to hear some other opinions and perspectives on which direction to take:  **Stick with Inspo #1 or go in the direction of Inspo #2/#3?**

I wanted the ring to be less traditional, and more unique, but I also want it to look good, which is of course subjective. Please share your thoughts on E/W bezel vs N/S prong vs tab setting. The ring will be in 18K gold and have a 2 - 2.5 ish mm band.

One is a fancy yellow (14k) and another is a U-V (12k). My partner slightly preferred the U-V. 

Our jeweller was telling us that warm diamonds (especially in elongated cushions) have been extremely popular recently. My question is: is the U-V a bad value and is more of a trend right now because of Taylor Swift / trends against lab diamonds? Is this a bad purchase and we should go with the fancy yellow?

Tried to do a good amount of research and have filtered to look for oval diamonds with the following:   
  
color: D  
clarity: vvs2+  
cut: ideal  
ratio: 1.3-1.5  
Table: 56-60  
Polish: excellent  
symmetry: excellent  
fluorescence: none  
depth: I don't see this filter on calavera, but looking for 60-63%.

In the research I've done, it looks like a major flaw with ovals can be the 'bow tie effect'. Do I just browse calavera for a diamond that looks like it doesn't have the effect? or is that mostly impossible to do through the online 360 photos? 

I've come across the following diamond that I think would be good. I'm not sure if I'm missing anything it looks like the bow tie effect is pretty minimal if any at all. Any and all help would be appreciated! thank you

Looking to purchase my wife a tennis bracelet for her birthday. She currently wears a Cartier panthere small watch on her left arm and a Cartier love bracelet the small (skinny) version in rose gold with the small diamonds on it. I’m imagining she would pair it with the love bracelet. She may also receive a second love bracelet in the soonish future so potentially both plus the bracelet. 

Is this bracelet from Quince a decent product?

Her wrists are on the small side (for context she picked the thin Love bracelet because the normal one looked almost ridiculous on her wrist) so I am not exactly sure the length or total carat weight to go for. From the options at Quince I think I would do the 6.75 length and the 4 carat weight (but maybe the 3 would be better?) in the white gold. Does that seem like a good option? First time buying one of these. 

Oh and yes I want to go with lab made stones for this.

But while white sapphires are a less popular choice for engagement rings, I love mine, so I wanted to give a little love to white sapphires. 

White sapphires are not as sparkly as some stones, but I love the softer glow they give. I would not consider them a diamond alternative due to the lack of sparkle, and they need frequent cleaning to stay shiny (I give mine a scrub with an old toothbrush and some dish soap about once a week), but white sapphires are lovely in their own way. I like their understated elegance, which suits my personal style better. I own other diamond and moissanite jewelry in smaller pieces for a little bit of sparkle, but I've tried them on as engagements rings and they feel too flashy for me.

Budget is to stay around 7-8k for the stone and around 2.25-2.50 ct 
Quality is most important, focusing on getting a near perfect stone rather than size, that being said I’m not really concerned with it holding value, just want it to look nice. 

Looking at the following: 
Lab grown 
Oval brilliant 
10.88 × 7.54 x 4.63 mm
2.46 carat 
Color D 
Clarity IF (Minor Details of Polish) 
Fluorescence None 
Excellent polish and symmetry 

Price $5,500

Before this, was looking at one that is significantly more money …

Lab grown 
oval brilliant 
11.31x7.59x4.57mm
Carat 2.43
Color D
Clarity FL
Cut Excellent
Polish Excellent
Symmetry Excellent

Is the look of IF vs FL really worth double the price ?

Because of that, I’ve been looking online and it's so overwhelming with the number of brands.. From what I have learned, relying on the basic 4Cs isn’t always enough to compare quality across different sites. I don’t want to assume all online jewelers are the same, but this is my first time buying jewelry for myself, so I really don’t know how to evaluate one brand over another.

I’m looking for natural diamond stud earrings, ideally 2–3 CTW, round cut, and set in white gold. My only real deal breaker is that I’m not interested in lab-grown diamonds whatsoever.

So my question is: What should I consider when choosing where to buy? I saw a few places that offer options to purchase an ""appraisal"" but is that required to ensure the authenticity of the purchase?

Is there a good starting point for researching online retailers, or should I begin with more well-known brands just to get my bearings? Or any places to avoid altogether?

I’m hoping to get some perspective from people who know more about rings and expectations than I do.

I originally set a budget of around **$6,000** for a platinum solitaire with a natural diamond. I’ve been doing a ton of research and even learning how to compare proportions, sparkle, etc. My girlfriend likes simple, dainty, elegant designs, so I thought a 1.2–1.4 ct princess cut with a 1.0-2.0mm pavé setting would be perfect on her 5.75 size finger.

I found her a 1.23 princess cut diamond that has color grade F, clarity grade VS1, 69% depth 71.4% table, Excellent polish and symmetry, and none in Fluorescence. I thought this sounded very good but I guess I have zero idea what she wants anymore. She told me dainty and I asked her if she would prefer a smaller higher quality diamond, or lower quality bigger diamond. She then told me that she would prefer a smaller higher quality diamond, but 5 minutes later told me that her last ring from her last engagement ""could've been bigger"" and it was 2.0 ct.

Then she mentioned something I didn’t know:  
she used to have a **2.0 ct marquise halo** ring and said it “could’ve been bigger.”

That threw me off, because now I’m not sure what size she actually prefers. I started looking at 1.5–2.0 ct princess cuts with good proportions, but those are easily in the **$20k–$30k range**, which is way above what I’d planned or what I feel comfortable spending right now.

So I’m stuck between:

* wanting to get something beautiful
* wanting her to feel excited and proud of the ring
* not wanting to spend 3–4× my original budget
* and also not wanting to buy something that feels small to her

Anyone been in a similar situation?  
Is it normal to adjust the plan, or should I reset expectations with her gently?  
Do most people in this size range save longer, finance, or pick a different shape/cut? (Not sure if I'd even want to pick a different shape, because she's expressed to me she loves the princess shape the most)

Any honest advice is appreciated.

1p9mpxw,jewelry,lab grown diamond,1764415663.0,2025-11-29,2025,11,Sold CZ engagement ring instead of lab diamond,"Trying to get a bit of clarity around my position here.

In mid 2018, I purchased a lab diamond engagement ring from a jeweler who stakes their business on making high end lab created jewellery. This was our main motivation for choosing them. Part of this hinges on the fact that in 2018, lab diamonds were still fairly new to the mainstream market and mine and, I think, the general consumer's knowledge around them has improved considerably since then.

At the time, my partner and I were told there were two ""tiers"" of lab created diamond on offer. One was chemically identical to a diamond and one was not chemically identical, but was visually indistinct and had the added bonus of not having any flaws. To their description, these would be completely flawless stones (a perk of the lab creation process!).

As you've probably guessed, it turns out, that second tier of diamond was cubic zirconia. For 7 years I've been walking around with a cubic zirconia set in 18k gold, absolutely convinced it was a lab diamond!

I think, had I had this conversation today, I would have the knowledge to challenge them on what the second tier actually was, and make a more informed decision. However, I think the jeweller intentionally used obfuscating language to confuse the two types of stone. They categorically did not say they were CZs, as I know what those are and it wasn't what we went in for. There is actually a reddit thread discussing this same jeweller's ready made line, stating that they mix the terms ""synthetic"", ""simulated"" and ""lab grown"" to refer to both CZ and lab stones.

My question is, what kind of recourse do you think I have here? I have an email stating that one tier of diamond is not ""chemically identical to a natural diamond"" but all of the paperwork I have describes the stones as white diamonds. Cubic zirconia is never once mentioned, in person or in writing.

Buyer beware, I know, but I do believe they have been intentionally vague, to sell low quality stones for higher prices.

I only found out because I went in to a local jeweller to get the setting on my ring adjusted, so I'm now considering just having the stones changed out at the same time, but should this be at my cost? The only upside is that genuine lab diamonds are now much more available and affordable than they were in 2018!",132,75,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/1p9mpxw/sold_cz_engagement_ring_instead_of_lab_diamond/

Here's the comparison between what TRR mentioned and the GIA findings. I ended up keeping the pendant even though the color was slightly lower than mentioned. I did wash the pendant well before submitting it to the GIA and believe that removed all the dirt, etc, resulting in a better clarity estimate. My main concern was to make sure it was a natural diamond as I read online its difficult to test for natural vs Lab w/o proper tools and I thought being a consignment store they might not have all the required tools/machines to test.

I always told him that I wanted a moissanite (lol, I'm frugal), but he wants the best for me. I told him that all I want is a ring that won't turn my finger green or break me out.   

We went around are area to the bigger retail sellers (JCPenney, Walmart ) just to get ideas of different cuts( were shy/nervous lol )  ( i was sold on a radiant cut, hard to find (cant find ) ) but then we went Sams club and we both fell in love with a ring there for 2000  3cart oval Lab grown diamond with 10 1 carts on the band.  We think about the ring all the time now. This past weekend, I tried it on for the first time! I'm in love...! The way it sparkles and shines is beautiful, like it was made for us. 

The only thing is, I'm contemplating whether it would be good to buy from them.

 I think the cons would be 

that we can't get it sized

no customization

If something happens to it other than what's covered, we would be screwed 

Pros: we save money, and you're not gonna find a 3-car ring for 2000 anywhere, nat or lab-grown 

  
He wants to spend the money. He told me that he feels like I deserve the best. He wants to increase our budget to at least 10,000 or 20,000  and I think that's insane. I feel like 3000 is a good cap, and the rest we use for a small wedding and then honeymoon for a couple of weeks. I would rather spend the money on are future.  At the moment, I'm leaning towards getting a custom ring and getting a lab-grown diamond, so at least we're meeting in the middle.

First off, let me say I did a stupid amount of research, posting, question asking (thank you to all who so very kindly answered all the potentially stupid questions I asked!) before finally pulling the trigger and ordering my very first lab diamond. While I have some very beautiful natural diamonds, what I want to have custom made would have been REDIC with naturals, so lab just made perfect sense.

I read reviews of multiple lab diamond sites. None were perfect (but like, who is?!) so I honestly went with Luvansh based purely on their pretty great reviews and their very low cost. And boy oh boy, other than a slight shipping snafu (which was 100% on FedEx and NOT Luvansh) this could not be a more perfect experience. This diamond is BEYOND my wildest dreams, and I basically have zero patience at this point and want my custom piece like, right now.  I had high expectations with this stone, and every single one of them has been exceeded. I will absolutely purchase from Luvansh again in the future. Blown away by their customer service, response times and updates.  And don’t even get me started on the diamond itself. I need to lock it up so I stop taking it out of the package to swoon at it. 11/10 recommend.",82,55,0.98,https://v.redd.it/hazoejqk9x4g1

But the story behind it is always something we will both treasure. My wife decided long before she met me that she wanted to pick out her own engagement ring. Her logic was that if she's going to wear the thing the rest of her life, she should find one she loves. I thought the logic was pretty solid.

A couple of years into dating, we started actively looking for rings. We searched for months and she just couldn't find anything that spoke to her. She is very particular about many things, and the engagement ring was no exception. She was getting really frustrated when one day she wandered into a pawn shop. She was searching through the less expensive ring section because she didn't want a big sparkly diamond. She wanted something more low key. Yet again, she couldn't find anything that she liked. So she decided to wander over to the case with the really pricey jewelry and just scope things out. And there it was - her ring.

She called me crying when she left the pawn shop. The ring was her ring. She knew it. She loved it, but it was about $10,000 more than the budget we had set. I told her then that we would buy the ring regardless, but she wouldn't have it.

She mourned the ring for months. Whenever we went near that pawn shop, she wanted to stop in just to look at it and see if it was still there. We even took extensive pictures of it and measurements for a local jewelry maker to see if he could recreate it within our budget. He tried, but he could never get it right. 

Fast forward to a little over a year after she first found the ring. It has been a couple of months since we had last seen it, but we found ourselves back by the pawn shop one day. It was still there. And they had dropped the price by about $5,000. That was still out of our budget, but it was getting closer.

We went back to the pawn shop about a week later and made them an offer for $5,000 less than what they were asking. Our logic was they had been sitting on it over a year. Maybe they were desperate. Turns out, they were. We got it for $10,000 less than their original asking price - just at the top of our budget. 

Sorry for the long post, but I love how we got this ring. We got a ring and a wonderful story.",457,32,0.99,https://i.redd.it/c9jwrpp4j25g1.jpeg

	•	Higher cut precision

I’d appreciate any pointers since I'm having trouble finding the right match.

What I’m looking for:

* **Cut:** Elongated hexagon / “Dutch marquise” (long hexagonal-marquise shape)
* **Carat weight:** \~ 3.0 – 3.5 ct
* **Color/Tone:** Dark green — I’m hoping for a rich, deeper green similar to emerald tone (or as close as lab-grown color options allow)
* **Setting plan:** Yellow gold, petal-style prongs (solitaire)
* **Budget:** $5-6k 

I really want a green center stone for a unique, vintage-meets-modern vibe. I’ve mostly seen white/sparkly stones in stock, but haven’t been able to find many lab-grown diamonds with the elongated hexagon / Dutch-marquise cut — especially in green.

If anyone knows of reputable vendors or custom labs that produce green lab-grown diamonds (or near-green) — especially in *uncommon shapes* like elongated hexagon / Dutch marquise I would be forever greatful.

Do you think it looks acceptable, or could it be a poor cut despite what the certificate says?

I’ve been searching for the perfect ring for my future fiancé for years. I have known I’ve wanted to marry her since the day we met. We’re both in our 30s, young hearts, but old souls. She loves art deco and everything postwar 1950s American culture, I love old American architecture and furniture, 60-70s music, ride motorcycles, and we both work in healthcare. I’ve come back to this engagement ring over and over and I’ve never seen anything she would like more. And hence my questions. 

On the one hand, the specifics don’t matter at all; I know she would absolutely love this and that’s all that’s important. On the other hand, I know very little about diamonds and rings and want to make an excellent choice for her. So, your help is appreciated. 

Both of us much MUCH prefer natural diamonds and yellow gold. I love the simple art deco design and the blue stones. We both only really like emerald or baguette cut. The center stone is ~1.5ct, SI1-SI2, M-. From what I understand some yellow color is not undesirable with yellow gold and may even compliment the design. 

Is that true of color and does this seem like a fine purchase? Should I ask them to source a different diamond for me? Should I prioritize one aspect of a diamond over another and does this fall short in some way? Would it be unusual to have a jeweler make the setting and I find my own diamond? Is that more recommended? I’m afraid another jeweler just won’t get some of the nuances right. Should I stop wondering and just buy what I like? Cost is also not really an issue.

Sorry if I sound stupid I’m just concerned if the diamond has a bad cut or not because I bought this when I didn’t know much about diamonds and good % for tables, depths, etc. 

When I go outside though it’s very pretty and white, sometimes even inside it’s still dark but it has that white light when it shines. 

But sometimes I can see its arrows and then other times it looks dull and I clean it everyday so I’m not sure.

For the sapphire ladies. 🤩,"I got engaged to my best friend the day before Thanksgiving! For those here for the ring, it’s a 2.73 carat untreated sapphire from Tanzania set with marquise cluster diamonds in 18K gold. Ring was purchased from Anueva, who I found through recommendations on here! Highly recommend them if you’re in the market for natural sapphires, they were amazing and so responsive! 

Our story is very non traditional and it’s been a long road. But if you like something that’s heartwarming, stream of consciousness, full of song lyrics and slightly unhinged - here’s our love story that I wrote for friends &amp; family on Facebook. 

-

Shine bright like a… sapphire?

Move over Rihanna, I got some once-in-a-bluemoon life updates to do. But does anyone actually use this platform anymore? I’ll admit, I have deleted the app and only use it via web browser like the geriatric I someday aspire to be.

Because all I see on here are rants about what a raging dumpster fire of a country we live in (true, but duh) and reels/ads that are trying to convince me I’m in perimenopause. Whatever the hell that is. 

Anyway, if you want a fun, yet heartwarming, yet way too long story from yours truly this holiday season – here you go. But if you ain’t got time for that (fair), SPOILER ALERT: Steve and I are engaged! For the rest of you crazy kids, here we go…

‘Twas the night before Christmas. Oops wrong holiday.
‘Twas the night before Thanksgiving. That’s better, but let’s go back further.
‘Twas the year 2016. Nope, further.
‘Twas the year 2015. There, that sounds right.

February 2015. The first time I met a Jersey boy named Steve. It was a friend’s birthday, and pre-bowling drinks were had at her apartment. I stepped into her kitchen to fix a drink, and that’s where I met Steve.

Steve was a runner and had just completed his first marathon. I was also a runner and had just completed my second marathon. Steve grew up in Bergen County New Jersey, just outside of NYC. I had lived in NYC for nearly a decade. Steve had moved to New Hampshire in 2013. I had moved back to New Hampshire in 2008. And on and on. We talked easily – the kind of effortless, immediate connection you don’t recognize as foreshadowing until years later. But that evening I felt like I had made a true friend.

Also, I was engaged. Now, this is part of the story that makes me sound like a creep. But I swear, no creeps be creepin’ around – sorry TLC. My (then) fiancé was at this same party, across the room talking to other people and eventually joined the conversation I was having with Steve. We both agreed – that Steve – what a great guy! And that was that. And a year would go by before I ever saw Steve again. Fast forward to…

‘Twas the year 2016.

May 2016. The second time I met a Jersey boy named Steve. It was at a weekly running club we were both part of. Steve was there, along with my other runner friends. We all ran together and somehow managed to have full-on conversations despite being in an anaerobic state – ah, youth. After, Steve asked me if I wanted to get a drink. I said sure, why don’t we invite others along? He made some excuse – and I was clearly oblivious to the signals. But we ended up grabbing a drink, just the two of us. 

Now before you go on thinking I’m a creep, I’m a weirdo. Well yeah, Radiohead was right. BUT! My life was not the same life it was the first time I met Steve. I was no longer engaged (no bad blood, we just weren’t right). I was a new homeowner. A new dog mom (Teddy). And fully immersed in the Wild Wild West of dating apps (gross). 

Like our conversation the year before, it was fluid and natural. Once again, it felt like I was having a conversation with my closest friend in the entire world. I was also completely oblivious to Steve’s signals, firmly assigning him to the friend zone. It wasn’t that I wasn’t attracted to Steve. But Steve was/is 7 years my junior. And I let the patriarchal bullshit get in my head on that. 

B.S. aside, it did allow me to let my guard down. With Steve, I felt like I could be myself. I could joke about how much I smelled in my running clothes and share candid stories about the nasty men I met on Tinder. I didn’t feel like I needed to act like a “cool girl” with Steve or do the show pony routine like I did on other first dates. With Steve, I felt safe, I felt accepted, I felt like I could truly be myself.

Fast forward to our friendship over the remainder of 2016. We ran together. We went out together. We wing-manned together. We shared dating app war stories. Steve formed a close bond with my dog, Teddy. Teddy knew Steve was “the one” long before I did. Dogs know. Steve did make a move on me once. But I stopped him, cause stupid ageist thinking on my part and I was seeing someone at the time. And I do solemnly swear, I am not a creep. But I am a weirdo.

December 3, 2016. A prohibition party at a local speakeasy, when speakeasies were trendy. Steve was there. All our friends were there. And someone else was there. A girl. A girl that a friend had brought with the intention of setting her up with Steve. She was beautiful. She was young. And Steve was talking to her. And I did not like it one bit. And suddenly, I thought: do I like Steve? Like, do I like like Steve? Yes! Yes, I did. 

So, I sidled up next to him, tapped him on his shoulder, stopping his conversation with that beautiful, young girl. He turned from her, and we were inseparable the rest of the night. After leaving the prohibition party, Steve and I snuck off to another local bar for one last drink. At the bar, we told people we had just gotten married at Disney World. People bought it, buying us shots and failing to notice that neither of us were wearing rings. Steve and I laughed – we both love a good prank. 

Then we went back to my home. There was a lot of awkward sitting on my couch. I was too terrified to make a move, and Steve was too terrified to get rejected again. So, we sat there, twiddling our thumbs waiting for someone to do something. Finally, Steve made a move and this time I let him. And so, it goes. When friends become lovers – which I think is a lyric to some song, but I’ve referenced enough music for now. 

Now, I don’t want you to think that the next 9 years was some storybook, Hallmark Channel nonsense. Because it wasn’t. Steve and I have had our highs and our lows. We have had our relationship tested, and a couple of close calls. But through it all, the friendship that we built, the bonds that were formed in those early days saw us through the darkest of times. And love. True, unconditional love. A love that was there no matter what. 

I didn’t know love like this existed. I have loved conditionally, and I have been loved conditionally. I have had my sparkle dulled by subpar men who wanted to dim my light. I have been made to feel like I was only worth loving if I was sexy, weighed x amount, looked a certain way, acted a certain way and kept my mouth shut otherwise. 

But never with Steve. He never stopped loving me for one moment. He has made me feel beautiful – inside and out – polishing my sparkle, lifting me up. Cause – LoVe LiFtS uS uP wHeRe We BeLoNg! Oh boy, guess the song lyrics are coming back.

And it took time to let Steve’s love shine on me. I didn’t trust it. I didn’t believe it could be true. Because experience had taught me otherwise. But over the years, Steve softened my edges and opened a capacity for love that I didn’t even know I had. He has given me the space and freedom to be me, the real me. He has supported me through many changes – leaving a career behind to embark on an existential crisis to figure out what’s next – which led to a brief turn as a hiking influencer, travels to far and distance places, working at a winery, going to therapy to exorcise the ghosts of trauma’s past, and finally to being a full-time graduate student (MSW), where I discovered my true calling: to help others, to lift them up, to let them shine. 

And I have supported Steve. Through his rotating menu of hobbies, his Amazon shopping addiction, injuries, job changes, a pandemic, the loss of our beloved Teddy, and the many life challenges that have been thrown our way these past 9 years. 
Steve told me early on that he would marry me when I was ready, and even if I was never ready, he wasn’t going anywhere. ‘Cause wHeRe tHeRe Is LoVe, I’lL bE tHeRe. Oh dear.

Well, it sure did take me long enough. But after 9 years of relationship and 10 years of friendship, I was finally ready. And on the day before Thanksgiving, we made it official. There was no pomp and circumstance, no down on bended knee – sorry Boyz II Men. It was quiet, it was us – and yes, I picked out the ring. And I said ‘Yes!’ to love, friendship, song and laughter with my best friend in the whole, wide world. But also ‘Yes!’ to hardship, loss, and whatever other garbage this crazy world wants to throw our way with my best friend in the whole, wide world. ‘Cause cOmE wHaT mAy, I wIlL lOvE yOu UnTiL mY dYiNg DaYyyyyyYYYYY! Oh wow, now Moulin Rouge is in on it. 

Well, I think I’ve said more than enough. And if any of you are still with me, phew! Thanks. But if not, it doesn’t matter. 

‘Cause it’s a little bit funny, this feeling inside. And I know it’s too much, but it’s the best I can do. My gift is my words, and this one’s for you. (And if you are not getting the song reference, Elton John is coming in for the grande finale!)

And you can tell everybody (on Facebook)
This is the song (telenovela, really)
It may be quite simple (actually not at all, I really need to self-edit), 
But now that it′s done (9 years later lol)
I hope you (Steve) don't mind
I hope you don′t mind (seriously, sorry you’re marrying this)
That I put down in (too many) words
How wonderful life is while you're (Steve’s) in the world

The end. Happy holiday season, all!

I was dead set on getting her a natural diamond while she didn’t really care if it was natural or lab made. 

Then I really learned about the finer details of diamonds and figured it would be much smarter to go lab made with all of the highest specs, as opposed to compromising with a natural stone.  

I also learned that, other than I guess the peace of mind, you’re overpaying for a natural diamond as it’s very much inferior to a lab. 

My mind was blown learning that we’ve been manipulated to believe natural diamonds are this rare thing that is valuable. 

Anyways, the stone I picked is in the top 1-2% of lab diamonds and I’m excited to hear what you all think.

I paid $1,220 for the stone, which honestly felt kind of insane for the specs — so I’m trying to make sure I didn’t miss any red flags. From what I can see, it looks super clean for a VS1, but I'd love second opinions from people who have a better eye.

Does anything stand out to you in the proportions, facet pattern, or overall light performance from the video? Or is this actually a solid pickup? I noticed in the 360 video there are dark specs. However, I thought this could be just dirt. And being VS1 (which shouldn't show anything to the naked eye) I thought this would work well. The dimensions to me were a unicorn.

1pikb2t,jewelry,lab diamond vs natural,1765316797.0,2025-12-09,2025,12,"Where to find quality, gold jewelry?","Hey everyone,

I’m trying to buy my girlfriend a piece (or a couple of pieces) of jewelry that she can keep for a long time, something that actually lasts and feels special, not fast fashion.

I’ve been putting money aside all year and have around $500 per piece to spend. I know that’s not “high jewelry” budget, but I’d really like to use it wisely instead of overpaying for branding or plated stuff.

What I’m looking for
•	Metal: Prefer solid gold (14k or 18k),But I’m open to solid silver for something well-made and substantial, given my budget.
	
•	I want to avoid gold-plated, vermeil, or gold-filled for the “main” gift.
	
•	Style &amp; vibe:Classy statement pieces, not dainty. I like more substantial, sculptural designs—domed, wraparound, wave/curve, interesting shapes—rather than ultra-thin bands.

•	I want to avoid engagement-ring style designs and avoid diamonds. No solitaires, halos, or anything that screams proposal.
	
•	Types of jewelry: Rings, necklaces, bracelets, possibly earrings or even a nice watch. I’m very open to vintage/estate pieces if they’re in good shape and fairly priced.

Where I’ve looked so far
	
•	I’m based in NYC. I’ve heard a lot about Catbird, went through their stuff, and… honestly didn’t love any of it for her.
	
•	I’ve browsed Etsy, but I keep running into: hollow “dome” rings that feel overpriced, unclear descriptions (plated vs solid), and big markups for what look like very light pieces that are not well made compared to older pieces I see.

What I really want is to avoid paying an absurd markup just for a logo or vibe, and instead find local artisans, bench jewelers, or vintage shops where my $500 actually goes into the metal and the craftsmanship.

What I’d love help with
	1.	NYC-specific recommendations
	
	2.	Etsy / online bench jewelers
	
	3.	Reality check : $500 to spend, what would you buy if your goal was:“One or two pieces she can own for years, good metal, good construction, not engagement-related, not fast fashion.” Any tips for spotting decent value vs obvious overpricing (especially in vintage and Etsy land) would be great.

I’m basically trying to spend this money in a way that respects the fact I’ve saved for it, get her something meaningful and durable, rather than just a trendy piece that will tarnish or fall apart.

Any advice, specific shop names, or examples of pieces you love in this price range would be really appreciated. Thank you

1pilupn,EngagementRings,natural diamond,1765320503.0,2025-12-09,2025,12,Help with sizing/picking an Engagement Ring,"Hi Everyone!

So, I'm chugging along my ring shopping journey - and I've crossed out most of the important details: budget acquired, desired main stone (lab Alexandrite), desired design, desired cut, desired color, hand size (size 4). I got a few more minor details but am running into a wall - I could use some guidance if you have some time.

**1. Alexandrite sizing for a size 4 finger**

What carat size would look good but not comical? My budget covers pretty much all easily available carat sizes for lab Alexandrite, so I'm not limited there. I want the biggest stone that doesn't look silly.

But most guidance I found has been for diamond, and I know carat/dimension for Alexandrite is different - it's less dense so a 2ct Alexandrite looks bigger than a 2ct diamond. There's no guidance on ""how much"" smaller tho, so I found it hard to estimate.

I'm attending a gem trade show next month which is where I hope to source the Alexandrite, so I want to have a target size before I go. And to add to the challenge, my GF wants a complete surprise, so I can't take her to go get stone sizes checked in person.

For those with Alexandrite or small ring sizes - what carat/mm dimensions did you go with? What's the sweet spot?

**2. Canadian diamonds for accents**

After going through this sub the consensus seems to be that Tiffany has inflated prices and not the greatest quality for those prices so, try a local jeweler. I consulted with my local jeweler, showed them the Tiffany necklace and told them my wife prefers lab grown diomonds, said I wanted \~.1 carat, and they quoted $2k, roughly $600 more than Tiffany.

I feel like Tiffany makes this easy... the blue box, easy to get serviced, easy returns if needed, easy to extend the chain if needed, easy resale if needed (I'm hoping this piece gets passed down to our child so hopefully we will never resell it). But I'm open to suggestions here.

I'm putting a high priority on quality. I anticipate she will wear this every day and we've bought jewelery from cheaper brands that break apart very easily.

The first thing I want to get are a pair of solitaire diamond stud earrings, because that's been my go-to everyday style of earring for most of my life (don't know how many gold plated cubic zirconia studs I've been through). I know I don't want to get a new pair of natural diamonds for ethical reasons, but I am torn between getting a second hand pair or lab grown ones. I have been looking in local stores for both types but neither seem to be a thing where I live, so either way I'm going to have to get them online, which feels a bit scary. Lab grown feels safer in a way, but second hand is more in line with my personal ethics, though that feels a bit like a gamble. I'm wondering if anyone has advice or tips on how to go about this?

First of all the love this ring has gotten is incredible! Rest assured, I absolutely promise all of you that we will ***not*** be melting or selling the ring. I have had my engagement ring picked out for several years before I even knew about or saw his family’s ring. My boyfriend complained about this because it would be convenient to put the proceeds towards my ring but he has been eating up all of your comments so thank you guys for helping to keep it in the family! The only mod I would ever do is resizing to better fit my finger.  


I talked to my boyfriend’s mom about the story behind it and like many of you guessed, it was reset around the 80s. The stones were originally set in my bf’s great grandma‘s wedding ring with the marquise in the middle and the two baguettes on each side. When that original ring was passed down to my boyfriend‘s grandma, she had it reset into the beautiful ring it is today. This ring actually has a nearly identical counterpart that was created with the diamonds from a wedding ring on the other side of the family. The main difference is that the stones in the counterpart are all round. My boyfriend’s grandma wore the counterpart and his mother wore the marquise everyday for years.

My boyfriend and his brother were named after the husband in the marriage of which the diamonds originated, so my boyfriend inherited the marquise and his brother inherited the counterpart. His brother has since used the gold and the smaller stones as part of his fiancé’s ring. They are planning to use the main stone for another custom piece in the future.

Anyways, thank you for the love you’ve given the ring! I have never seen anything like it and am so glad you have enjoyed it as well",52,2,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/1pjn0nu/update_great_great_grandmas_ring/

He's wanted to buy me this dream ring for years, but I could never find one that matched my memory. 

Somehow I stumbled on the Natural Sapphire Company. I saw mostly positive reviews, (except for one in this forum) and I decided to move forward with designing my own ring with them. Honestly, I am blown away with how perfect this ring is, and with the responsiveness, knowledge, professionalism and talent shown by my salesperson who was guiding me through the process. She sent me the stone to examine in my home, along with the independent gemstone reports, and a 3D printed model of the ring to try on. 

I absolutely love this ring and it exceeded even my very high expectations. Set in platinum, the sapphire is a Tanzanian 1.77 ct eye-clean, no heat, bluish-green. Side diamonds are F color, VS1 half moon shaped for .50 total carat weight. The price was very reasonable, much cheaper than similar rings with smaller sapphires and diamonds that I had seen in jewelry stores or online. Here's a photo:

My boyfriend and I have been together about 1.5 years, and have briefly talked about getting engaged at some point in the future. We share a passion for second hand things/thrifting. And I’m obsessed with antique jewelry/thrifted jewelry and so when talking about a ring I want something with character and not necessarily brand new. 

During a fairly successful eBay bid, I won a diamond and after taking it to a jeweler, it turns out to be a 1ish ct old clear European cut diamond that’s about 100 years old (picture included). I am not opposed to having that diamond used for my engagement ring but I don’t want my boyfriend to feel a type of way that he didnt buy the diamond himself (he would use it for a custom setting, i would leave that up to him). A natural antique diamond that size and clarity starting is 5k+ and I don’t want him taking a loan for a ring.

Years Ago I bought an engagement ring (if I read the receipt right)… it’s a 18 karat white gold semi-Halo ring with 20=1.04Tw G/H color VS2 diamonds With a 4 prong center that can fit a 1.0 Karat Round Diamond. The ring retailed for $2975 but I got it for $2300 (was that a good deal?)

Anyway the intention was to spend another 5-7k on a nice natural round diamond for the center but in the meantime the center stone is a high grade cubic zirconia that’s starting to look like shit. The real diamonds surrounding the center CZ is really noticeable now. I’m married now and bought her a house and we have a kid on the way so spending 5-7k on a rock is out at the moment. (This economy sucks but we’re making it) 

Since I care less if the diamond was found under Mt Fuji’s ass or it was made in a lab… I can get a lab grown flawless F color excellent cut diamond for 2k or less

My question since the other diamonds are VS2 G/H color… would the center stone match those gradings. Should the Center stone be no higher than VVS2 and G color?",15,4,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pm2hyl

Ive been looking to replace my earring collection cause I developed a metal sensitivity and ended up going down a rabbit hole of scam jewelry practices, Etsy scams and sourcing ethical jewelry in general. I’m trying to find shops in the average persons budget that have certifications that their items are what they say they are, maybe a certificate that an item is ethically sourced etc. This is mostly just out of curiosity because it feels like a huge chunk of info is just not available on this which is wild to me. Yes, I am that kid whose favourite questions were: “Why? But how? But Why?”

It can’t be right if Opal stud earrings are $14.99CAD? I’m fairly savvy about potential scam jewelry by looking at the price, if the design seems to be everywhere, reviews, etc. but I’m not familiar at all when it comes to gemstone quality and what their prices would be for real or synthetic. Is it even possible to get great quality gem earrings for under $100CAD?

I’ve tried searching online for ethically sourced jewelry companies, cross-referencing those to Etsy, reading tips about how to tell if the store is likely a drop shipping company, signs of good/bad manufacturing quality, how to make sure I’m not supporting blood-diamond-esque companies, comparing prices between handmade small businesses vs fast fashion and while this helped, it’s still not easy to look at a shop and really see what you’re buying. Idk, I hope this makes sense. I wish we had better laws when it comes to quality of a product.

I’m based in Austin, TX but open to online or mail-in options if the craftsmanship and communication are solid.

The concept I’m going for is masculine and modern, not a wedding band (this is a gift for myself). Think vertical or east-west bezel setting, brushed finish, flat or squared profile, possibly two-tone metal or hidden personal details (like engraving or flush-set gemstone inside the band). Attached a mockup for reference. 

Ideally, I’d like:

• A jeweler who accepts outside stones (lab-grown)
• CAD previews before casting
• Experience with bezel settings and masculine proportions
• Reasonable turnaround time (4–6 weeks is fine)


Any recommendations for jewelers or websites that specialize in this kind of work? Bonus points if you’ve had a great experience with them or they offer collaborative design options.

I know a lot of people have used Aurelinne to source stones, but I haven’t seen many reviews of their settings and overall ring design process. Overall, their setting options are more limited, but they had exactly what I wanted within the price range I wanted! 

Specs: 1.55 carat oval center stone, F, VVS2. Set in white gold, additional .23 carats from side stones. 

Experience: Andy was very communicative! I asked some questions and there were no delays. I received pics and videos before it shipped, which was much appreciated! Order was placed on 11/14, and I received my ring via UPS on 12/12. I’ve had a lot of delays and issues with FedEx lately, and I was glad this came via UPS! 

The very last picture shows my rings over time - original e-ring was a natural oval cluster with halo and side stones. I loved it but it was not my forever ring. The middle one is a natural upgrade from earlier this year. It was unexpected but it was pre-owned, found at our preferred local jeweler, and we got a pretty good deal on it! My original wedding band is soldered onto it now (I’m unsure if I will keep it that way). I do love my natural upgrade very much, but I found myself missing some of the round and side stones look, which is how I ended up finding the Aurelinne setting. 

I’m currently wearing a straight shared prong round lab band with my ring but I’m worried about the stone damaging the setting, so I have a curved band arriving today.

The band is 14k white gold with (20) small diamonds in a ‘twist’ pattern (0.1ct weight).

A local jeweler offered me $600. Should I cut my losses and take it, or do you think I could get more private sale? Should I try to sell the diamond and band separately since I purchased them separately and had the ring assembled (everything was from Blue Nile if that makes any difference)?

I couldn’t get myself to let it go, but I think it’s time.

I paid about $2500 for the diamond and band from BN.

It’s a 0.55ct round, brilliant cut, natural mined diamond. IF (Internally Flawless) clarity. Excellent cut and excellent polish. I color. Medium blue fluorescence. GIA certified and certificate is available.

The band is 14k white gold with (20) small diamonds in a ‘twist’ pattern (0.1ct weight).

A local jeweler offered me $600. Should I cut my losses and take it, or do you think I could get more private sale? Should I try to sell the diamond and band separately since I purchased them separately and had the ring assembled (everything was from BN if that makes any difference)? Sorry if this is not the right place to post this. It’s emotionally overwhelming to deal with this at all, but I don’t want to get ripped off too bad just to offload it. I know diamonds aren’t an investment and know I won’t get full price. I just never thought I would be in this position.

I took the ring to a jeweler and figured while replacing it, I’d go a little bigger and got a 1ct lab oval cut. I just got it back tonight and something about it feels gaudy?

1poon44,Diamonds,lab grown diamond,1765949905.0,2025-12-17,2025,12,Filthy diamond ?,"Posted on behalf of my fiancée –

“Hello everyone,
I would appreciate hearing a professional opinion from those who understand the subject.

I’m attaching two photos of an engagement ring:
The bottom photo — on the first day after receiving the ring.
The top photo — after only about 4 days of wearing it.

This is a lab-grown diamond, color grade F, step cut (emerald / hexagon), set in a bezel setting.

During the first days I wore it, I could hear tiny noises, as if the diamond wasn’t sitting 100% tightly inside the setting.
The saleswoman told me this is known and acceptable for this design, and that it’s done intentionally so as not to damage the diamond due to its special cut — but not to a degree where the diamond could fall out.
(Additionally, there is an engraving on the underside of the ring; I’m not sure if that’s relevant.)

After a few days (while I’m looking at my new ring all day 🤩), I noticed that something had changed. It looks as though there is cloudiness / “fog” in the center of the stone, while the edges appear cleaner.

There was no impact or unusual use — just normal daily wear and a few showers.

• Could this be dirt or moisture trapped under the stone?
• Is it possible that this is an issue with the setting or the structure of the bezel — that this tiny opening didn’t seal against water penetration or something similar?
• Can something like this appear in a lab-grown diamond in such a short time?

Thank you very much in advance for any opinions.”",22,14,0.92,https://i.redd.it/7jsx06bqbp7g1.jpeg

So I wanted to share the story somewhere people love to share about their rings! 

My mom gave me her original engagement band that SHE designed in the early 80s in NYC, which is just so special to me. The band stayed the same way she designed it, with only a minimal resize and reset.

The stone on the other hand was a process!:
I always thought I would want a traditional diamond ring, but my husband and I went to a consult at a local jewelry store and I absolutely fell in love with a pale yellow sapphire. It caught us both off guard because I went in expecting to want a 1-1.5 carat diamond (not to spare expense, but rather because I’m not the girliest person at allll, and I’m typically not very flashy in any way). However, that local jeweler wouldn’t work with my mom’s band, so we contacted another small jeweler and they agreed. 

They started looking for 1-1.5 carat yellow sapphires (and we both wanted lab grown initially), but the ones they were importing were AWFUL. Like the color of dehydration urine 🥴 I couldn’t have worn it every day for life. Eventually it was decided that what I was looking for was only naturally occurring, so they took 2 more tries to find and import me natural stones in the light yellow I was looking for. The first one was not quite right, and the second one I think they got tired of me lol and just said “hey we found the one, but it’s a little bigger than you wanted.” Turns out it was 3 CARATS BIGGER than the 1-1.5 carats I wanted. It was so much bigger that they had to change the setting on my mom’s band to hold the new stone. 

Anyways, that’s the story of my ring, and I love looking at it daily 🥰🥰 

Shop local!! This ring at any chain jeweler would’ve been way more expensive, especially if we had to start from scratch with the band, and they DON’T care about their output like a local shop does! ",22,3,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pp1zls

I understand they are a natural mined diamond, but What are they and what makes them different than an untreated? Noticed there’s a decent difference in price. 

Are they weaker, prone to getting damaged, require maintenance/ have to go through the process again to retain the improvements? Also, how are they viewed lesser than lab grown ones (I.e, what’s clout around them) ?

Certifications:

I know that GIA is the gold standard in the industry and there’s several others (IGI,AGS,EGL,etc.) , but does it really matter? What makes GIA so good v.s the others? What are the trade offs and risk of not getting a GIA?

It’s a little over 1ct, round.  I’ve worn it as a pendant almost everyday since.  (I’ve reset once and repaired chain once). The chain broke again so I need to get it re-set.   The cost to do that is quoted $375-465.00 (white gold).  

I see 1ct lab diamond pendants for about $580 or so.   So I’m wondering if I should just buy a bigger lab diamond (1.5 to 2.5ish ct) as an “upgrade” - I recently got a promotion instead of paying a relatively large amount for the same thing.  

If I do upgrade my necklace, what are some ideas for the original round diamond?  I have a daughter but she’s young and I already have round diamond studs that I love.  In case relevant to your advice, my engagement ring is also a round diamond solitaire.

1prikhy,jewelry,mined diamond,1766248710.0,2025-12-20,2025,12,Lost bracelet after wearing for 2.5 years. Found something odd?,"Hi everyone,

I am the type of jewelry person that seeks pieces I can keep on 24/7 with basic maintenance.

My last chain purchase was in 2023. I shopped with a brand that is out of state for me, in person, to give a chance to another jeweler. (MX)

I had a couple red flags I ignored that seem to be odd to me now:

- the chain type, paper clip: they had a huge roll of pre-manufactured chain, but I assumed that explained why it wasn’t so “expensive” to me at the time. (My only other bracelet is custom made with a matching anklet, from 2021)

- the 14k gold hue: despite being a small jeweler and not advertising any brands, they had different shades of 14k gold unintentionally (so I initially wanted another bracelet but it was too yellow for my taste in person. The lady said the chains I was wearing were “old” which is why they didn’t look yellow. Btw my oldest chain at that point was 4 years old. I just ignored her and found a bracelet that hit the less yellow hue I like, the paper clip). To my understanding that’s just the metal mix, of course dirt/grease can superficially alter the hue before a clean…

When I lost my bracelet on Thursday, I was fully expecting the clasp to be the reason why. I reached out to the business to let them know and they said it was unfortunate but that I should’ve done maintenance on the bracelet every 6 months to annually. They also said it’s a super popular bracelet and they have never had an incident like this from a customer. (UGH my eyes roll to the back of my head every time)

I replied basically saying BS, every 6 months is for something like a diamond ring. A simple bracelet shouldn’t be needing so much maintenance. I suggested they improve their quality. I mentioned I looked at the paper clip bracelet on their website and within 2.5 years, it costs 3x as much and it looks thinner than mine. 

They said “Thanks for the feedback” and happy holidays bye basically. 

But guess what? I found the bracelet under my couch yesterday.

I found the bracelet and it was not the clasp as I had suspected. Please see pictures.

Now, I’ve been wearing gold jewelry since I was around ~19 (27 now). I do not take my pieces off unless I am taking them to get checked and/or cleaned. I was very surprised to see that the links where it snapped off were not broken or bent. I was under the wrong impression that jewelers weld/solder the links closed. This one was not?! (See the solo link pictures, it does not require force to open, sliding my nail was enough to show the place the link “closes” on)

I messaged the business again basically saying “guess what?, it was not the clasp, not even maintenance could’ve prevented this.” With a picture And they left me on read, lol.

So currently I am so mad I let myself buy from a place like this but most importantly I’m still like WTF at the links just being slipped into each other.

Can someone confirm to me that links are meant to be welded shut on chains like these? Am I crazy for expecting that? 

The only thing I’m grateful for is I lost this dang thing at home, and not at class or the street. Got some evidence here and wanting to hear opinions, because I am burning to submit a long-ass google review for this business. I’m also grateful that this thing held on basically with nothing to hold it together for 2 years? I’m feeling so many things right now. I have a link somewhere under my couch but I’ll keep looking…. Just frustrated.

Thanks so much

FYI: I know there are some bent links in the middle. I took this bracelet to a Metallica concert in Mx City and was against rail. Those bent links are pretty sentimental to me now, but they aren’t why this dang bracelet fell off me.",0,9,0.31,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1prikhy

I’m looking for some honest advice from people with more knowledge about diamonds and jewelry.
I’m in the process of buying an engagement ring from a local jeweler who has been in business for about 40 years and has good reviews. The ring would be €1000 total, including:
a 0.40 ct round brilliant diamond
Inside a 14k yellow gold setting.
The diamond is described as very old, taken out of an antique ring, and the jeweler is now setting it into a new ring for me. So the diamond is not newly sourced.
I asked about a GIA certificate, but he explained that:
getting a GIA certificate takes time
sending it to Antwerp would significantly increase the price

He guarantees it is natural diamond, and he will provide his own written documentation including details in receipt.
I do trust him as a professional, and I don’t think he’s trying to sell something fake. Still, this is an emotional purchase (engagement) and I’m a bit nervous without an official lab certificate.
My questions:
Is this kind of deal realistic for an old diamond?
How risky is buying a natural diamond without a GIA/HRD/IGI certificate?
Would you personally be comfortable with this if the jeweler guarantees authenticity in writing?
Is this a red flag, or just old-school jewelry business?

I have a question about terminology and how this is generally viewed in the jewelry world.
I’m in the process of buying an engagement ring. The diamond comes from an older ring (so the stone itself is not newly mined), but the setting is a new 14k yellow gold solitaire, custom set by a jeweler.
The jeweler mentioned the diamond is “old” or “from an old ring,” which made me wonder:
Is this actually considered vintage or antique?
Or is it simply a new ring with a repurposed natural diamond?
Some are worried about energy/history, I’m mostly curious about whether it’s fair and correct to say that:
this is a new ring, and my wife will be the first person to ever wear it as a ring, even if the diamond itself existed before.
In other words:
aren’t most natural diamonds technically “old” anyway? And does the age of the stone really define whether a ring is vintage, or does that depend on the setting/design/era?
Would love to hear how jewelers and collectors usually look at this. Thanks!

If the conditioner right, natural diamonds should be able to form as quick as a few weeks. They just aren't brought to the surface and discovered for the next few million years or so.
So the rough stone that we extract might be aged a billion or 3 billion years old, but I think many sources get it wrong when they say that diamonds need 1-3 billion years to form.

My point is if we are able to create hpht diamonds in perfect laboratory conditions within weeks, then natural diamonds (carbon essentially) shouldn't take to form over 1-3 billion years in similar high pressure, high temperature conditions. I'm not saying they aren't, but the general ""product description"" from jewelry stores and jewelry websites will consistently say this is the time it takes for diamond formation.",0,4,0.42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamonds/comments/1psubep/the_actual_time_it_takes_for_natural_diamonds_to/

Hello - two questions about this natural diamond (it's a ring, not sure if that means much).

First, is there a big difference in time of year one might sell a diamond (wholesale, of course)? That is, are most Jewelers tied up at this time of year where it might affect their bidding on Worthy or even if I walk into a Jeweler?

The second is just confirming the value(s) we've been given. At first glance we uneducated (public) naturally think a 6 ct diamond of reasonable grade is valuable. Such is true with everything, tho-i,e, ""My house is worth, my car is worth"".

My fiancé had the original vintage hand cut diamond (1.62 carats, S12 clarity) removed and (carefully!) replaced with the current one. We will be creating a ring for our daughter with the original stone.

Girlfriend saw an ad for this ring on Brilliant Earth, and loves it.  She says it kind of has the vibe of her mom's and grandmother's ring, but is also inside and not a copy.  She loves it.  She said it doesn't have to be from brilliant earth or anything, she doesn't care where it's from, but she said she's sure that's the design she loves and even after a few weeks she hasn't changed her mind.  

On brilliant earth, after custom choosing a diamond and matching it to the ring, it was within my budget and everything.  But I didn't know anything about them, so I looked at some reviews on reddit and I'm seeing a LOT of bad reviews.  I also saw that even this sub has a warning about them in their official guide thing.  I haven't really been able to find the exact style on any of the more popular and trustworthy sites, but I'm still looking and may have missed them.

Anyways, just wondering if anyone off the top of their head knows anywhere good to get this? Obviously another option is just getting it custom made from a jeweler.

Would only recommend if you’re prepared to deal with service issues.

My fiancé and I bought our engagement rings from DiAi Designs, primarily dealing with their Mumbai store. We live in the US, so this was our first time buying diamonds online and coordinating internationally. This was a one-time, high-value purchase (₹2.5L+), so naturally we were cautious and asked a lot of questions.

The good: The craftsmanship is genuinely very good. The final rings look beautiful and were delivered on time after resizing.

The bad (mostly service-related):

• Communication was slow and required constant follow-ups. We often had to message twice just to get one response.

• For customized jewellery (which they actively market), we were oddly expected to calculate costs ourselves when exploring different combinations. We even requested pricing in Excel to avoid confusion—never provided.

• Gold price fluctuations were understandable, but transparency was not.

Major red flag:

When my future father-in-law went to the Mumbai store to place the order, the staff told him the price had increased by ₹27–30k due to gold price changes. When asked for a breakdown, the representative became rude and dismissive, saying we had been “asking for too long” without ordering—despite him being there to place the order.

After escalation and repeated questioning, it turned out the actual increase was ₹3k total, not ₹30k. My fiancé had to intervene on the phone due to the attitude. This alone almost made us walk away.

More issues:

• One ring arrived loose even though we ordered the correct US size. Resizing was done, but we had to absorb gold wastage costs.

• When sending rings for resizing, we were never told to send the certificate. Only after resizing—during pickup—we were told it was required. The store is 1.5 hours away.

• A complimentary keepsake memory box was promised but never given. Later, we were told we hadn’t provided required info—info that was never requested. Now they expect all rings to be returned again (we live in the US and had our engagement already).

Complaint handling:

We tried escalating this formally via email, expecting an independent review. However, the response came from the Mumbai store itself, so you can probably guess how objectively the complaint was handled.

Their response:

The reply largely deflected responsibility, blamed “confusion due to back and forth,” and suggested missing information on our end rather than acknowledging service gaps. For a brand selling customized jewellery, this was disappointing.

Final verdict:

✔️ Craftsmanship: excellent

❌ Customer service (Mumbai store): poor, dismissive, and unprofessional

If you’re considering DiAi Designs, go in with eyes open. The product may be good, but the experience—especially at the Mumbai store—can be exhausting.

When I first received it from my (now) fiancé, it appeared the most beautiful bright, almost forest green in the sunshine. But I see blue-grey, sparks of bright, mid blue, more classical real, and it even reflects reds and purples occasionally from the environment which looks really cool too. My mum often sees purple in it. Plus of course the diamonds add so much sparkle, especially in lower lighting! Feel like I have the best of both worlds!

I'm not sure of all the specs atm. I know it was made by an independent UK jeweller. It's natural, pear cut sapphire (not sure if heated or not), 18ct yellow gold, diamonds (which I have been assured are ethically sourced as that was important to me). Ring size R (uk size. I believe that's equivalent to a US 8.5 or 8.75..)

I would quite like to get an extra prong added to protect the point, but also considering just trying to be very careful and leaving it as is because my fiancé said that part of what he loved about it was that you could see the shape so clearly like this..

It’s also lab grown because as a former rocks and minerals competitor, those are insanely cool to me! 

Here’s the dilemma, his brother and my best friend are now engaged (not to each other, in separate relationships) and we’ve seen both of their rings. He made the comment that he feels bad now that mine is so small. I hate that! I love these rings, they are very me, and I didn’t want a large stone. I’d have been upset with a large stone because I’d have been worried about it constantly. I grew up running around the country barefoot in the mud, I’m not a big diamond girlie. Also, I like the band more than the original one I picked out as my “favorite”! The set together is also simple, elegant, and very earthy to me which I love because I love flowers more than the average bear. 

Also, I know some people don’t like the look when their rings wear down, but I LOVE that my engagement ring looks a little more yellow than my band. I wore my engagement ring for the entirety of our two year long engagement. In my eyes, I think the fact that my wedding band looks newer, reminds me of the fact that I am going to get to wear this wedding band long enough for it to be worn and kind of yellow.

The center diamond itself is 6150$ while the trillions are 750 total (.75 carats total for the 2) and the band would be 1350 for the gold and all the work. My total is therefore around 8150$ and I just want to make sure this sounds like a reasonable price?

1pwh1yp,EngagementRings,lab grown engagement,1766788377.0,2025-12-26,2025,12,Is this 3-stone ring setting poorly executed?,"​I had this 3-carat 3-stone setting done by a highly-reputed local jeweler, using 3 lab grown stone that I brought in. The first picture is the end result for my ring, while the second picture is of the same type of setting but with smaller stones (~2.2 carat I believe). He had the ~2.2 carat version in store and he showed it to me when I was choosing a setting, saying he would recreate it for 3 carats.

​It is only after I got home and looked at the ring very closely that I noticed that the shared prongs (the 2 prongs that are in between diamonds) are very noticeably misaligned. I know that technically it is because each prong supports one stone, but in the model I saw in store (picture 2) the shared prongs look much more aligned from the outside.

​Was my ring set poorly, or can this difference be justified, perhaps by the larger carature? The misaligned shared prongs are not as aesthetically pleasing, but it is a detail that can only be noticed when inspecting the ring from up close, so I guess I don't mind it too much as long as there is a valid reason for it and the setting can still be considered well made. However, if this is just a poorly made setting, I would take it up with the jeweler and ask him to fix it. Looking for an outside opinion before I confront him.

All of my engaged friends have a huge rock. Something that looks incredibly expensive, while I doubt many of them or their spouse have 5-6 figures of money to drop on a ring. They may have a decent income, yes, but the rings legit look worth more than their annual salary. Most of them also claim that the diamonds are mined which is surprising as I’m pretty sure those are incredibly pricey. My lab grown jewellery has always been much more affordable compared to my mined pieces. 

It’s really none of my business but I am really curious where this trend is coming from, where they are potentially getting their rings from etc. Maybe it’s just me but I’ve always grown up around my relatives, even the wealthier ones, having rather modest rings with a small diamond or no rings at all. Now it seems that everyone is just casually wearing a 6-10 carat diamond ring to the office.

Hey sorry if this type of post isn't allowed but I wanted to share this to make people aware. About a year ago I bought a ""lab grown diamond ring"" for my now fiancé. We never thought to test it until she was playing with a diamond tester at work lol. When she tested it, it came up as moissanite, so we got it tested at Kay's jewelers. Turns out it is actually moissanite, the engraving inside the stone did not match the IGI certificate either. Luckily I kept all of the receipts and even have the IGI certificate stating the stone was supposed to be a diamond. We will be going back to JCPenney soon to see what can be done about this I will update here with hopefully some good news because I did not pay moissanite price lol. Anyways, if you bought a ""lab grown diamond"" from JCPenney I would get it tested if possible.

We met with a jeweler who showed us warm color, natural, champagne diamonds. I’m wondering if these prices are reasonable or if it’s overpriced? I don’t know a lot about the pricing, especially for this type of colored diamond. These quotes are just the diamonds. 

For the ring, she says the custom setting in 18k yellow gold would be around $3,500-$4,000 depending on the final amount of gold.

We also asked if champagne comes in lab, since we don’t care about natural. However the jeweler said for lab “there’s just fancy light yellow and fancy yellow. There is no such thing as colors k-z in lab stones. And if they are, they are not cut properly. I showed you two lab stones at our meeting that had fancy yellow and fancy light yellow coloring. 

The champagne color in lab just simply doesn’t exist”

Are you? What size do you love as your personal max and why?

I live in an HCOL area where even before labs, it was routine for folks to have 2 and 3 ct min mined diamonds as engagement rings. Folks here often got married later and have high income jobs so it isn’t unusual. Some even had larger 4 and 5 ct stones. 

I have a gorgeous three ct mined radiant that was part of my engagement ring prior to labs in fancy cuts really being a thing. I think the look on my size 5 finger is balanced and works for me everyday. 

Now I also have a 5 ct emerald cut lab give to me for my bday not too long ago which also looks stunning. It’s definitely something that stands out, and I confess I feel a bit more self conscious in it than I do with my 3 ct mined ring. I still am reticent to wear it to work, although I have no trouble wearing it out in other settings I can’t imagine going any larger than 5– especially for my hands and lifestyle. What about you?

We had the engagement ring custom designed by a London workshop but I just got a wedding band from a brand with a couple of branches and it is more mass produced. 

I bought the wedding band to compliment the engagement ring and I didn't mind that they didn't fit completely seemlessly together, they were close enough that I still love how they look together and we weren't expecting to spend as much on the wedding band. They are both platinum so I thought they would be safe to wear together for longevity. 

However, I've seen some posts about rings having wear on the prongs when they rub together and decided to check mines. 

I think I can see some tiny indents on the most central prongs on either side of the central diamond. Is this a sign that the prongs may become unstable due to wear with time? Or am I imagining it? Do I need to stop wearing them together? 

Please excuse the dirt on them, they need a good clean. The rings don't seem to touch much when the stones are aligned but they spin around a lot. I don't even wear them all the time as I take them off to shower and took them off for a few months during pregnancy. In the last couple of months I  recently took to wearing them about half the time on a ring catcher necklace as I was getting an eczema flair under them from trapped soap and water.

Recently, lab-grown diamonds have started getting more mainstream coverage here, including on SVT (public service TV). The framing wasn’t hype-driven, but more about how lab-grown diamonds are now actively challenging the traditional diamond trade.

For context, lab-grown diamonds haven’t historically been very common in the Nordics beyond lower-grade alternatives on the high street. High-quality lab stones have been harder to access locally, which is why I buyers here have looked abroad.

What struck me is how late this conversation feels compared to the US or UK. The Nordics tend to be relatively conservative when it comes to luxury and big-ticket purchases, and adoption here seems to lag a few years behind Anglo markets and parts of continental Europe.

That said, the tone does seem to be shifting. Lately, among people I talk to, the discussion is less “are lab diamonds real?” and more about:
	•	price transparency
	•	ethics and sourcing
	•	whether mined diamonds still make sense for some buyers

It feels less ideological and more pragmatic.

I’m curious whether others in Europe are seeing something similar, or if this is just my own impression:
	•	Are you noticing a lag or a shift where you are?
	•	Do people still feel hesitant, or is that changing?
	•	Any EU- or region-specific challenges you’ve noticed when buying lab-grown?

Interested in hearing other perspectives.

I’m hoping to gently help him since researching and shopping isn’t really his thing. I’m leaning toward a lab-grown diamond and, if possible, something emerald green since I love green so much. Any suggestions for good value and budget-friendly options would mean a lot. Thank you ☘️",1,13,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngagementRings/comments/1q008fw/best_value_for_a_ring/

Hey all, would love some input here. I’m choosing a jewelry gift for my cousin (19yrs), and I’m torn between more affordable brands (like KELM) or custom-making a pendant necklace.

The reason I’m considering custom is that the dog who’s been with her since she was little just passed away. If I go that route, I’d want to make a pendant inspired by her dog. Ideally I’m thinking of using a lab-grown diamond, but I’m not sure if that might feel too serious or expensive for a 19-year-old.

The diamond is beautiful. It sparkles with no bow tie effect. The chain is so thick! For many of the other brands I looked at, the most common complaint was thin chains, so I was relieved to see how nice this one was! You can see it next to my Tiffany necklace, and it is much thicker.

The customer service was also excellent! The pendant in the group buy had a long ring, and I wanted a floating look so they customized it with no extra charge. They were promptly and thoroughly responsive to all my questions and provided multiple CADs before producing the final product. They sent videos/pictures of the diamond and pendant before shipping which was also great. The process was fast and smooth, and I will definitely purchase from them again!

The third photo is a normal earring trying to show more detail/size reference to the divot in the bezel.

My fiancé and I were at an event over the holidays and her diamond fell out of her ring. She's only worn the ring \~25 times since she got it early last year and usually keeps it locked up in the original box. She said she had noticed a click sound/feeling and so she checked it, touched the diamond, and felt it was fine and looked to still be securely in place. But ... about 30 minutes later, while at the event, she looked down and noticed the diamond had fallen out.

The ring is covered by insurance and we do have a meeting with the jewelry designer scheduled to address and facilitate a repair, but I wanted to post here asking for general information/experiences and advice so we can be prepared to ensure this doesn't happen again.

Is this a normal/common issue? Bad luck? Bad design? She had requested a bezel set specifically as I guess they are less prone to coming loose compared to prongs, so we are both surprised this happened.

I'm not sure what to expect when we speak with the jeweler and so wanted to ask about any experiences with ring repairs of this nature - what should I expect in the process? Any information I should have handy and any specific questions I should come prepared with? Any advice on how we may alter the design to prevent this from happening again (if possible) - is there anything you can garner from the photos that may indicate any insight into how a bezel set diamond could come loose so easily?

Thanks in advance for any input, info, and advice - this is our first experience with something like this and so appreciate any info to help us be better prepared!

I inherited a 1.5ct marquise diamond from my mom who passed.

I had it reset in 2022 (the year I got married) to a simple solitaire setting. My stepmom worked in jewelry forever and knew someone who did the setting for me.

It’s great, but the diamond has come loose 3 times already. 

The first time I paid $280 to have it tightened (I live in NYC). 

The second time, I paid $100 to a booth at the diamond district someone recommended to me and they completely butchered the prongs. The next day I found a local store who would redo the prongs for me for $300. 

That place did an okayish job, but the prongs are sharp now and often catch on things.

Anyway, the diamond came loose AGAIN.

Reddit jewelers helped me realize that the nature of the setting would cause this to keep happening, so I am not pursuing a new setting.

I went to yet another jeweler whom I trust (they did my wedding band at a reasonable price) to discuss, and they had a cool semi-beveled setting for a marquise that I think is pretty cool. 

I am SO READY to be able to regularly wear this ring again. I haven’t been able to wear it without either the stone being loose or spiky prongs catching on everything in over 2 years.

All that said, before I pull the trigger on this new setting, I’d love to crowdsource any potential setting ideas.

My absolute musts:

- yellow gold
- Solitaire
- Stone unlikely to come loose (aka sturdy)
- Not totally beveled 
- Fairly simple

I’ve attached a photo of the current setting (6 prongs) and the setting that I’m thinking of redoing it to be.

1q2nejk,EngagementRings,mined diamond,1767421923.0,2026-01-03,2026,1,Lab diamond advice for yellow gold bezel ring - old mine / antique cut style,"Hi everyone,

I’m in the middle of designing an engagement ring and could really use some advice from people who know lab-grown diamonds and antique-style cuts.

The general direction I’m leaning towards is an old mine cut (or similar antique-style cut), ideally an elongated cushion, set in yellow gold. I’m quite drawn to a bezel setting, possibly with a very subtle split shank, or even small corner prongs instead, still undecided there.

To give a bit of context, the stones I’ve been looking at are roughly in this ballpark:

	•	Around 1.3–2.0 ct

	•	Face-up sizes from about 8.0 × 5.7 mm up to \~9.8 × 6.7 mm

	•	Ratios roughly 1.35–1.45

	•	Tables anywhere from the low 50s up to low 60s

	•	Depth roughly 59–64%

	•	Mostly E–F color, VS clarity

Price-wise, the diamonds themselves seem to sit somewhere between €1,000–€1,700.

A few things I’m struggling to get my head around:

	•	For a yellow gold bezel, which specs actually matter most in real life, depth vs table vs face-up size?

	•	Do elongated old mine cuts generally work well in bezels, or are there certain proportions that tend to look flat once set?

	•	Would antique cushions or old European–inspired cushions be worth considering instead?

	•	Does this size and price range sound reasonable for a lab-grown diamond like this, or am I overpaying? I’ve been told old mine cuts aren’t as popular, which seems to make them pricier than brilliants for example, not sure how true that is.

I am trying to understand which proportions tend to look best once set, and honestly to get out of decision paralysis at this point (I’ve been stuck on this for about 3 months now).

I’ve attached a photo for reference, the top ring is a style I really like, and the bottom one is something I tried on in-store, though it’s a different type of stone.

Thanks a lot in advance, any insight and tips are really appreciated.",10,4,0.92,https://i.redd.it/ug3j3krsw2bg1.jpeg

* The stone will be set on yellow gold
* We dislike the very elongated/skinny marquise looks
* Prefer 3.5-4c

Help!,"I just got engaged, and my fiance gave me an absolutely stunning custom engagement ring. However, I noticed soon after that the ring doesn't really refract light near the center. I inspected it closer, and could see it is cloudy with some visible inclusions near the top center of the ring [The top left and bottom right photos were taken with my phone, and shows what can be seen with the naked eye].

The other photos in the collage are the ring under a microscope. You can see the cloudiness much more clearly here, and beyond that, it even looks like theres a little black fiber within it! I thought there may be a fiber on the surface, but no, after cleaning and drying, it is still there, deep within the ring. 

Am I right in saying there's no way this could possibly be a VVS1 diamond...? I can clearly see the inclusions and lack of fire with my naked eye 😩.

My fiance was upset when I first mentioned spotting the inclusion to him. He said it made him feel bad - which i totally understand. But I didn't realize at the time that this is specifically classified as a VVS1! It makes me feel like we would have a right to ask for a new diamond from the jewler, whereas usually custom rings are final sale. But it seems this was falsely sold as one thing, but is really a lower quality diamond. These inclusions are not even listed in the IGI report! 

I told him all along that the one thing I care about with a diamond ring is the sparkle. I don't care how big or small it is. So, it's disappointing for both of us that he went all out and paid for this large, VVS1 diamond, and it has this issue. 

I'd love to know people's opinions on whether you think its a VVS1, or whether anyone has experienced something similar, and what you did about it?

I can't find anything comparable online. The pearl is huge. It's one solid slab and it's 65mm from top to bottom. And the three stones on the setting are diamond.

I would like to know more about this piece. If anyone has insight I would love to know as this type of jewellery seems to be either rare or was never common to begin with.

I honestly cannot tell the difference between them with my naked eye, so I need some objective opinions on which one is the ""better"" buy.

**Context**:

• **Wearer**: My girlfriend has very small fingers (Size 5.25), so we found that this carat range (\~0.45–0.50ct) actually looks the best on her hand without being overwhelming.

• **Preference**: We are set on a Natural Diamond, which is why we are sticking to this specific size/budget range rather than going for a larger lab stone.

I like to tinker and make things on my own my now fiancé loves the fact. Here it was no exception. No prior knowledge, just some Aliexpress, Reddit and lots of Youtube.. Also we like it simple and don't like any pretentiousness which also includes overpriced diamonds and gold or similar. Needed to be something minimalistic, simple. So I chose Argentium silver - perfect harmony of easy-ish to work with and resilience and tarnish resistance.

Pretty much everything is made from scratch: wax carved by hand, made the mold, burnout, melted way too much silver and poured it. First try, no test runs - I didn't have the time, procratinating took it's toll as I was nervous I would fail - I guess it was meant for success :). It's not perfect in all its imperfections but it grew on me while I polished it. I wanted to make it look organic - nature inspired as we both love the outdoors and there's something about a giant tree in a forest clearing that's just magical and I think I got pretty close. Wanted to make it look like roots grabing on a stone.

Box is also DIY, from a dead fruit tree I felled in our garden and CNC'd it with my also DIY CNC machine I have to seriously upgrade as the wood turned out to be way to hard for my flimsy CNC and it came out all wobly. Wood wax is also locally sourced bees wax mixed with cooked linseed oil.

All in all it was a long time comming so the answer was always to be yes (altho I did it in perfect secrecy with 0 clues on her behalf). Important note: size is perfect and all it took was joking around with one of those plastic-metal cable ties to make a measurement.

i now know that i need to specify how i want it set, but i’m wondering if it would be cheaper to get it custom made or to just order from an online jeweler? at the jewelry store we went to, they charged $800 for a 1ct round lab grown diamond with less than ideal specs. that’s ridiculous, so i’m looking at buying the diamond online now that i know the exact specs i like. plus the diamond is only worth about $200. the total cost of the ring was $1400. so, my main question is how much would it cost if i bring my own diamond and ask to have it set like in the pictures i have included?",3,3,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q62u7e

1q65c1m,labdiamond,lab grown engagement,1767758944.0,2026-01-07,2026,1,Advice - Fancy Blue Lab Stones,"Hi everyone! My next project is likely to be 2–3 ct fancy blue lab-grown stones for a pair of earrings, and I’m hoping to get some insight from people who’ve gone through the process of buying a similar color stone.

Shapes I’m considering:
• Oval
• Heart
• Emerald cut (still debating)

Vendors I’m looking at:
• Starsgem
• Fiorese
• Provence


What I’d love feedback about:

• If you’ve worked with any of these vendors, how helpful was your sales rep when it came to choosing a stone?
• When you asked for videos in different lighting (indoor, indirect light, shade), did ur sales rep help without hesitation, or was there pushback? I know there can be a language barrier at times, but I’m hoping to work with someone who understands why seeing multiple lighting conditions is important for fancy blue stones.
(I ordered a Columbia emerald recently and the color was slightly off from what I expected/envisioned based off the videos I received pre-shipment so I’m nervous and hoping to avoid disappointment this time)

Color performance questions:
• If you own a fancy blue lab diamond (any shape), how does the color look indoors or in softer lighting?
• I have sapphire pieces from Costco that look great in sunlight but go quite dark indoors, and I’m trying to avoid that effect with these earrings.
• I’ve attached two reference photos (both taken under bright lighting) I’m aiming for a blue that stays lively and visible in everyday lighting without being too light

I’ve done a lot of browsing here, but most posts show the beautiful final product rather than the selection process, so any firsthand experience would be really helpful.

I am currently shopping for engagement rings in the 1-1.3 carat range, lab grown.

I've gone to a handful of jewelers where I live (suburbs of a large Midwestern US city) and generally gotten quotes for around 750-1250 for a diamond with decent ratings on the 4Cs (VS1+, F+, Very Good+).

However, one shop is offering a lab grown diamond (VS1, E, 1.25ct, Idea, IGI) for around $500. They had several diamonds in stock in this range, it wasn't just one that was super marked down or something.

I like a good deal, but is this suspicious? What questions should I be asking? Or is this fine? 

I like this jeweler, it is a local mom and pop shop, they would be doing fairly simple custom work in-house on a reasonable timeframe, they have decent reviews, and have been in business in my area for decades. But, I just want to make sure it isn't some scam. The price seems almost too good to be true, and I know very little about this world of diamonds.

I officially get to marry the love of my life! ❤️ I'm so glad I researched here. ​ SO many people in this sub recommended oval shape if you wish to elongate the look of your fingers, which was super ideal to me as a plus-size girl. Over the past decade, I saw dozens of people I know get engaged with white-gold round or cushion-cut diamonds, often with halos. I never wear silver jewelry, and I never liked halos or round diamonds for myself, but those came off as the ""go to"" style &amp; left me less than enthused for so long. The reading &amp; browsing I did on this sub/sites recommended by this sub gave me the confidence to pick something different from my Facebook circle of peers! ​

Specs: The diamond is a 1.58 carat lab-grown oval, VVS2 clarity D color. The ring is a 14k size 9 band with milgrain detailing around 3 round side stones on each side, about 0.015 carats each, F color. I shared a list of my own ideal specs for the diamond, I picked out the band with my partner there, and then he came back &amp; made the calls on final touches (the setting height and deciding between a few stones).

I'm still feeling the TINIEST bit of sadness over my band simply because I did let go of my original vision. I spent months wanting a nature-inspired band with leaf-shaped/floral-inspired side stones, but every band like that that I tried on in-person or virtually left me feeling dissatisfied. The side designs either didn't quite feel like ""me"" or took away too much from my desired focus on the center stone. I couldn't see myself liking them in 20 years. So I picked something that feels more timeless to me and as a bonus, I still got something special to me with the little pair of heart shapes in the head setting (see last photo)! ❤️ Any questions are welcome!",215,51,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q6j5u7

I got engaged last year and it is about time to start looking for a wedding band. My engagement ring is a gorgeous 14k white gold with aquamarine center stone with pear, baguette, and round natural diamonds on the band.

I am absolutely OBSESSED with my ring but struggling to decide on what would compliment my ring well while fitting flush with it as well.

I dont know any proper jewelry terms im sorry! But where the setting is for the larger center stones, it sticks out slightly on each side compared to the main band, so im almost certain a regular band wouldnt sit flush.

Please give me all of your ideas!! Im open to bands or enhancers, i just want my gorgeous engagement ring to pop and it is important to me that my rings sit flush!

I was in love with the top but decided to go with the bottom and I just need some reassurance 🥲. BTW, not my hands, video is from the jeweler/seller.

Both Diamonds are a trademarked/patented cut, cut to remove an ovals bow tie. I had previously purchased a 3.95ct E color VVS2 oval but returned it because it was too big and I realized I didn’t like the bow tie in a traditional oval brilliant, even if it was minimal. So I found this seller that offers both crushed ice and the patented oval cut that completely removes the bow tie. I chose the patented oval because I felt it sparkled more than the crushed ice and still had similarities to the oval brilliant, minus the bow tie. 

Now for specs:

Top oval is 2.75ct, VS1, D color 
Bottom oval is 2.46ct, VVS1, E color 
both patented cut 

I chose the bottom because they didn’t seem too different in size, and the bottom is only one grade lower in color but two grades higher in clarity. I felt the clarity mattered to me more than anything, because the diamond I returned was E color and I actually didn’t mind. They’re both IGI certified.

To be honest, I know very little about fine jewelry and didn't have some specific look I wanted before my partner and I began discussing it. As we researched, I knew I wanted yellow gold, sapphire (not a diamond center stone), and that it needed to be sturdy because I am clumsy -- so nothing too tall. Another jeweler told us yellow gold is outdated, but I have always associated it with wedding jewelry and don't really like platinum/white gold/rose gold (for me -- they look great on others!).

My partner ended up creating this customized (see edit note) ring with a sapphire center, little diamonds on the side including salt and pepper diamonds. The stone is actually oval but they created the look of a more geometric stone with the setting. To be honest it is basically exactly what I asked for but with his own choices.

Anyway...my mom has been making negative comments about it to me and to my sister, and it's just kind of put a damper on it and made me doubt my own tastes. She also seemed disappointed that it was just a very simple, private ask, which is what I wanted. I know I shouldn't let that get to me. So I wanted to post this here because hopefully someone else out there likes it and is supportive.

edit: I just want to say thank you. I felt embarrassed posting this but to be honest, I just really wanted to hear some good feedback after feeling bad. That said, I do want to clarify that my sister has been incredibly supportive, sorry for the poor wording! Also, poor-ish wording -- for those curious, a local jeweler had the band (it was open in the center) and my partner was discussing custom plans with them. When they pulled out the band, my partner was like, ""that's perfect,"" and then they customized adding in the center stone, which is a vintage sapphire. Thank you so much for being supportive.

1q6rc5z,EngagementRings,lab created diamond,1767819222.0,2026-01-07,2026,1,Advice on lab grown alexandrite ring from Oore,"Hi! I’ve currently got my heart set on a ring from Oore, as I have never been a fan of traditional engagement rings and I love non traditional stones and settings.

I’m pretty sure about going with white gold and am considering a few different stones: lab alexandrite, lab dark green or dark blue sapphire, or dark green tourmaline. Mildly considering a lab green diamond.

Alexandrite is a really cool stone and I’ve been fascinated by the color changing properties for a while. However, I’m a bit nervous about the fact that I won’t really know how the exact stone will look in different lightings and such until I receive it. 

I’ve looked at a bunch of alexandrite listings on her website but I can’t find any examples of the range of colors the stone can present. Most of the photos show it as a dark teal, with some leaning more blue and some leaning more green. 

I think I prefer the ones that lean more green.

But since I’ve also heard it’s so hard to accurately photograph alexandrite, can I even trust those photos?

After writing this it had occurred to me that with ordering online, I can’t put a lot of weight into the colors I see in any of the stones I am considering as they can all be a bit different… but it still feels like there’s a lot more potential variance for the alexandrite.

Has anyone ordered an alexandrite ring from oore or any other online jeweler before? How did what you receive vary from the photos listed? 

Anyone with alexandrite rings (lab or natural), can you share your experience? 

Should I just go for it? Is it worth reaching out to Uma and asking about the different color variations and if a more green alexandrite is an option?

Did any of you green lab stone owners manage to get your rings for under $1k?

I’ve seen a lot of amazing green rings on this sub but I’m not sure I can make it happen on the budget I have. My sweet partner is in school and working part time but really wants me to get me my forever ring seemingly this year. His budget is probably $500-$700, with a bit of wiggle room. I could maybe find what I’m looking for in a really dainty setting, but I don’t have a graceful bone in my body and I need something tough (i.e. signet or at least bezel with some thickness to it). Size of the stone/sparkle etc doesn’t matter to me. The green does though. I’m a neutral or warm green person, so blue leaning green isn’t for me.

I’m getting close to being worn down and settling for a colorless moissanite even though my heart wants green. It seems most USA stores work with natural stones, lab diamonds, or clear moissanite. I might be ok with overseas, but he really wants to take over this process himself and I don’t feel comfy sending him off into that world lol!

This is the closest I’ve found for a setting example, but it seems like she only works with mined stones.

We decided to shop local for a lab-grown diamond on a 14k white gold solitaire setting. Right now, I am in the market for a 3-5 carat emerald-cut diamond (VS1, F, ISI certification).

I think some men might not perform the most research going into this, seemingly, as this should be a one-and-done transaction, and the feeling of going to a local jeweler would give you the impression of getting a great deal.

After seeing rings that matched what we were looking for, I wasn't surprised to see a 10,000-12,000 USD price tag. I made sure to do a little more research, and found another local business. This time, it was a brick-and-mortar wholesaler nearby and the price was closer to \~6,000 USD all-in (\~4,800 USD for the stone itself). A substantial difference.

This massive price drop made me realize I needed to do even more work to ensure I was getting value from my purchase. I then go online and see discussions about buying these diamonds online. I found one for $645 on Luvansh after discount codes, and how you can take advantage of price matching to get a great return policy if needed.

The brick-and-mortar wholesaler offers some price matching, but there is no way they'd likely meet the price Luvansh has. Is it worth supporting the local business, getting the perks of free cleanings, and building a personal connection for potential future adjustments? Or, is it best to just buy the loose stone and find someone to set it?

I just cannot believe the markups of some of these businesses. Some of which I understand, do to rent, paying employees salaries/insurance, utilities, etc. Do you folks think it is worth not getting an exact price match to get some of the perks of buying local?",22,44,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/labdiamond/comments/1q7kg04/would_you_rather_buy_online_and_save_or_go/

$3600 for the stone

$1550 for the setting

After a $750 discount the subtotal for the full ring comes out to $4400

I may be looking to upgrade the setting to platinum instead of 14k gold, which would be an additional $600. I’m not very familiar with the market value of different stones.

It was so helpful, 1) to get the reassurance that I wasn't being crazy and 2) there was some great advice about them using grading language and that even them saying a CZ is indistinguishable from a diamond was dodgy. We ended up trawling back through every bit of communication we had with them and found that at absolutely no point was the term ""cubic zirconia"" used, but they repeatedly referred to them as diamonds and didn't correct us when we did the same.

So we had a week of back and forth, during which they offered to polish the stone (!) and just doubled down. Helpfully for us, they kept using the term ""a type of lab diamond"" to refer to the CZs in their argument, which really proved to us that it's an ingrained part of their marketing, and not just a mistake. It became really clear that we weren't idiots - they truly had gone out of their way to use opaque language.

We ended up sending a letter before action (thanks to everyone who suggested next steps, but we're in the UK, so our route was small claims court). They accused us of defamation (!!) but caved very quickly and offered a refund, which we have accepted and received. I gave them the option of replacing the stones with true lab diamonds but I didn't expect them to accept that, and I'm not sure I'd have trusted them anyway.

I'm glad it didn't drag out, but I am almost disappointed it didn't go to court. I think we had a very strong case and by accepting the refund, they don't face any kind of consequences. They are a brand that regularly places pieces on celebrities like Taylor Swift on red carpets and music videos, and a public court appearance would be justice in my mind. As it is, their website is unchanged, although I hope these days there's enough information online to stop people making the same mistake.

We took the Christmas break and will start shopping for a new ring this year. On the one hand, I'm excited - I love jewellery and it's fun to shop for such a special piece, but on the other, I have had to hand over the ring I wore on our wedding day, the ring that's in all the photos of me holding our newborn children.

I’d lost a couple of the small diamonds from the band, but their company had quoted me $750 to repair and felt that was a little ridiculous since we were supposed to have a guarantee on the ring. Eventually the band snapped as the picture above. I hate the setting because it’s just not safe or comfortable to wear. The ring is in this condition after just 3 years of wear. 

Since my rings have a spiritual meaning to me and my marriage I decided to just go to a local jeweler and have my head stone reset on a new thicker band so I at least had SOMETHING to keep from my wedding and I loved my pear shaped head stone anyway. 

The jeweler calls us back and says the stone is a CZ and it’s been scratched up because they tried to buff it as a diamond. They actually won’t handle the gem anymore at all. I am absolutely heart broken that I basically have nothing from my wedding day, some of those loved ones are no longer with us and we will never have their prayers back for a new ring. 

Is there any kind of recourse for scams like this? Has any one else dealt with Diamond Nexus? I’m just in shock. The ring came with a special certificate and everything stating the gem was a lab made diamond. ",436,100,0.95,https://i.redd.it/7g7i30c4ylcg1.jpeg

I am planning on getting an engagement ring for my girlfriend soon, I've talked about what she may like with her but we want the ring to be a surprise for her. The picture attached is what we are drawing inspiration from, but want all the side stones to be diamonds.


I reached out to a jewller and asked them to use this for inspiration, but they just recommended to find pictures online of other styles which was kind of unhelpful. I was curious about what different kinds of orientation of side stones are out there, we'd prefer irregular settings like the one in the picture as opposed to straight lines of side diamonds. I was curious to see if anyone here has any other inspiration I can draw from? 

Also, I mentioned to them we wanted a lab diamond for a multitude of reasons and he linked me a stuller webpage for a $1220 CAD 1.26 CT vvs2 main stone, I've only found negative things when looking up stuller as a distributor. I was curious if anyone else had any leads on where to source a diamond where we won't be getting ripped of more or less, which is one of the key reasons by girlfriend wants a lab diamond. Any input on those questions or how I should respond to the jewller is really appreciated, I've felt a bit overwhelmed by it all. Thanks!

Around June last year I started visiting local jewelers for some inspiration on engagement rings. My girlfriend had previously sent me one of those engagement ring quizzes which by total luck I aced, so thought I knew what she wanted. Let’s just say I’m glad I didn’t solely rely on the results of that quiz! One of her friends had used Brilliant Earth and they had a great experience (only sharing that last bit because I subsequently read lots of negative reviews here). We visited Brilliant Earth together and also had a good experience, they had a vast array of bands and diamonds in store and it definitely helped my partner to understand what she did and didn’t like. It was also a fun thing to do together.

The ring she wanted was a three stone setting with a lab grown radiant diamond. The diamond itself was 2.8 ct, E color, VS2 clarity. After several appointments with Brilliant Earth to finalize the exact diamond and setting, I placed the order for roughly $4,600. This was over what I was planning to spend but I had the money so rolled with it. The diamond itself was about $2,700 and the setting was $1,900.

Another friend of mine then mentioned his experience with Brilliant Earth, which was pretty terrible. In Brilliant Earth’s defense, he said he thinks the ring his partner wanted was probably a poor design which contributed to it having to be fixed few times. Regardless of that, his experience sent me down a rabbit hole and I started looking on Reddit for other options. That’s when I came across companies like Ruby Harper and Calavera and started to understand how much companies mark-up the actual costs of the lab grown diamond. (Again, I appreciate a company like Brilliant Earth with actual brick and mortar stores have higher overheads and they do provide benefits such as physically being able to try them on).

That said, once I realized I could get the exact same diamond (literally the exact same as you can check the diamond IGI number in the same catalogue they all use) for over $2,000 less, I started thinking about canceling the Brilliant Earth order. I didn’t have a fixed date for my proposal, which meant I had a little bit of time to be flexible and order another ring. I am the sort of person who would have been looking at the ring for the next 20 years knowing I had unnecessarily spent $2K extra that I didn’t need to (fully aware that isn’t a good quality but at least I know it about myself!). I reached out  to Ruby Harper because 1) other good reviews on Reddit 2) I like using small companies 3) she is based in Tyler, TX which by chance is where my fiance’s dad is from and that seemed kinda cool. Once she confirmed she could meet the date I needed (delivery by Christmas) I canceled with Brilliant Earth and placed an order through her.

Addison, who I think runs Ruby Harper was brilliant the whole time. Communication was good (responded to all my emails promptly which is another must for me) We got the CADs agreed pretty quickly as I knew what I was after, the ring went into production and arrived just before Christmas. Total cost was $2K and in my humble opinion it looks absolutely stunning and the quality is great. I'd happily use her again for our wedding bands.",27,12,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/labdiamond/comments/1qa4xy0/ruby_harper_review/

I’m a size 6 and tend to prefer larger stones because they balance my finger shape better. I also wear a lot of jewelry and feel very comfortable with statement pieces.

My only hesitation is how noticeable a larger ring can be in everyday life. I’m confident in my choice, but I’m curious about others’ experiences with more eye-catching rings. Do you find people make awkward comments or ask uncomfortable questions, or is it mostly a non-issue?

For reference, I can add photos of my hands with other rings I wear regularly, along with a few Amazon try-on rings I used to test size and scale. 

Thank y’all so much in advance. Any advice is helpful. We've also decided that a 3mm band will help with me feeling the diamond is more secure.

I kept the engagement ring safe until the wedding day, and in the morning we swapped the rings out together. He then gave me the band again during the ceremony. 

Not everyone’s cup of tea but it worked for us and I absolutely adore my rings. I had no solid feelings on ring design or type other than I didn’t want anything too big and I wanted something quite sturdy.

My goal price was to just to pay under $2,000, preferably due to other circumstances. Also, service members don’t make the most money lol. 

I’m treating this ring hunt as the same way as shopping at a dealership for a used car! Avoid giving into sweet talk and gleamingly exciting ways they try and get you to buy into crazy contracts. 

We went to Kay’s and started looking around, found a really nice Oval ring. I saw the APR on one of them and the terms in months and sad a hard no.

She doesn’t mind anything. She wouldn’t mind if I proposed to her with a ring pop or a rubber band! But I still want it to be special. I don’t mind lab grown diamonds, I just want  her to have a ring she can keep and wear forever, not turn her finger green, and not break under regular day to day wear.

It's a bunch of small diamonds ""melee"" 
When it arrived, it was shipped by a third-party merchant, even though the website did not indicate this. AAFES usually clearly separates third-party vendors, so this was unexpected.  The ring arrived with only a ring in a typical box.  No receipt, certificate, or paperwork. Nothing  For a $4,000 ring, that doesn’t sit well with me. To my untrained eye, it looks like the same ring in the image but there’s nothing verifying the 3Cs or confirming the diamonds are natural rather than lab-grown. I have never heard of this third party “Suasshish Jewels” so that makes me question this. 

I plan to have it appraised by an independent jeweler for peace of mind, but the lack of documentation feels strange. I can still return it, yet I have a nagging feeling something isn’t right. My concern isn’t lab grown vs natural diamonds themselves. My issue is the possibility of being purchasing one thing based on specific attributes but receiving something different than what was advertised. The third party bothers me because it just opens the door for details not being accurately conveyed. I priced similar style of rings and they retailed for much higher. 
Another weird plot twist is I ordered this a month ago. Each time fed ex attempted to deliver they would state “undeliverable nobody was home”. I made countless calls to FedEx because FedEx would not even bother to knock or they didn’t even bother to deliver. I couldn’t update online bc every time I logged in it would an error message saying “package can’t be updated”.  Not a big deal but when I finally sorted it out and they delivered to a Walgreens it was January 10. So when I pick it up January 11, it just happens to be 31 days preventing me from returning through the online system? Not sure why 30’days starts when the order was placed and this may be coincidental but it’s just one more thing that makes me feel something isn’t right.

Second, the Diamond was listed as super ideal, but when the certificate arrived the cut was listed as a 'very good.'

However, I’m looking at et toi style, styles with multiple diamonds at the center, and settings that have diamonds in the band. We could buy just a new setting and extra diamonds for $3000+ but I started thinking couldn’t I just purchase loose smaller diamonds or even a low priced second hand engagement ring and ask a jeweler to melt it down, pop out the stones and put my moms in the center and totally customize a new one?

I’m planning to get quotes but I have no idea what’s reasonable with this. Lots of people post about resetting rings especially jewelers but they don’t say how much it cost and usually just do a before and after. Has anyone done this recently? Did you run into issues? How much does it cost? From the prices we are being quoted by local jewelers for the designs I wanted it would seem this option would have to be cheaper.

I also wonder why more people who want mined/natural don’t do this if they want it more ethical, is there a reason not to or any risks?

Every jeweler I called/visited was willing to use an outside stone. No Jewlers brought up any risk of destroying the diamond or old ring after inspecting it. Some jewelers were willing to use some of the gold for the new setting, I would say most were not 40/60.

In the 5th picture you can how low profile it is, which I really wanted because I work in healthcare. It doesn’t snag on gloves or anything else, and I never have to take it off! 

I had never seen one in person so I was worried it wouldn’t quite scream “engagement ring” or would look like glass, but there is no mistaking it! It sparkles in that diamond way on the edges and refracts in sunlight.

It is elegant, minimalist but attention grabbing, and so so me. I still get compliments or people asking to see it closer so frequently even though I’ve been married for a few months now! If you’re considering a portrait cut I would highly recommend!!

If you have any questions about pricing or other specs I’d be happy to share :)",529,50,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qc79vp

I love simple and timeless looks and I also love unique and flowery designs as well. The two rings I’m debating are completely different. 
The first ring is from a “big box store” aka- Kay’s and yes, I’ve read the warnings about the diamond quality and mark ups. I’m a simple girl, and I don’t want anything too fancy or expensive so the ring I like from here is perfect. A simple; pear shaped (lab grown) diamond with a halo underneath. I love it, it looks timeless and is the exact cut I want. It’s on clearance for a decent price, or at least they make it seem like a good price. 
The second ring is from a small, privately owned jewelry store here in town, I saw the unique, flowery band and fell in love. I have never seen anything like it- online or in person. It’s stunning, very unique and part of me worries I will maybe not like it as much over time because it’s so different. My taste in rings has changed a lot over the years- according to my Pinterest board, I didn’t like a single ring I had pinned just five years ago. This ring would be a custom make because I want a pear shaped center stone, so the price is over 3x the first one. I’m worried about it being so expensive and maybe not liking it one day. 

I don’t have anyone to talk to about this except my boyfriend and he isn’t much help, he knows I love both so is being neutral. So I thought maybe some online opinions would be helpful in deciding.

I’ve been married almost 10 years. My original engagement ring has a 1.2 ct natural cushion-cut diamond that my husband bought when we were young and it was his first big purchase, so it’s very sentimental to him (and somewhat to me). That said, my style has changed a lot and I honestly don’t wear the ring much anymore. Day-to-day, I usually just wear my diamond band from our 5-year anniversary.

We’re also in a different financial place now and I’m trying to decide between:
- Redesigning my original diamond into a new setting that fits my current style like possibly adding a sapphire, like a toi et moi design (see inspo photo attached) or
- Getting a completely new ring for our 10-year anniversary and eventually repurposing the original diamond into something else.

If I redesign, I’m also unsure about:
- Natural vs lab-grown sapphire (I have some lab grown diamonds which I love but not sure if there is a strong reason to go either way for sapphires specifically)
- Whether to work with a local jeweler or an online/custom jeweler (I didn’t love my first local experience)

I’ve attached photos of my current ring, my current set including the band I wear daily, and some sapphire + diamond inspiration.

If you were in my position, what would you do, redesign or start fresh? Any regrets from people who’ve redesigned their rings?

I love jewelry and unfortunately get bored easily. I love my engagement ring, pictured (been married 7 years now but I like the look of it without my wedding band best) but I’m really feeling like getting something totally opposite- just a single solitaire on a thicker yellow gold band. I’m kind of emotionally attached to this diamond my husband picked, even though it’s not really the greatest stone (natural, 1.01ct, H color, SI2 clarity). So, I’m debating between having it reset into a nice plain gold band with potentially a more secure setting than the one it’s in now, or (for probably the same amount of money or not a crazy amount more honestly) keeping it as is and just picking a lab stone to go in the new setting. In this case I would probably go up to 2ct and up the clarity at least if not the color as well. What would you do? Will resetting my diamond ruin the current setting, potentially damage the stone in any way?

I always wanted my Diamond to be from there too, but back then I didn’t know all the intricacies of diamonds and the price associated with natural compared to natural that’s tracked &amp; traced. I also didn’t want an unethical diamond.

I'm not good at videos but u/JPathway\_UK Thank you for your help and reassurance this would be a good stone for its specs! It really is! It even goes dark in certain light but def not the blue or icy greys that I didn't want. David sourced the stone. 

Specs: 1.40ct,  Color: G  Clarity: VVS2 

Cut: Ideal ; Table 58% Crown 35.4 and Pavilion 40.7

 

Setting: Custom David Klass ""Trigold Braid"" (Rose, White, and Yellow Gold with G natural pavé with hidden halo.

Inspo and our story: A cord of three is not easily broken Ecc 4:12. I saw it from a Mark Silverstein design but I wanted trigold and white not pink diamonds on the rose gold. 

I fnally understand the ""Carnival vs. Elegant"" debate. My previous H&amp;A MoCo AGS000 Moissanite was beautiful, but it had a ""neon"" fire with flashes of lime green and electric pink that was too much in certain lighting. Especially grocery stores or any blue light/fluorescent setting was my main dislike. It also had a persistent ""cloudy"" look on the side facets that no amount of cleaning could fix (I now know it was light leakage and double refraction!) It had a 59.8% table that somehow fell in MoCo super idea but it had a large table reflection that really bugged me as well. 

This new lab is a completely different experience. Everything that I fell in love with round diamonds years ago. Instead of that neon glow, I have ""firecracker""scintillation and depth with crisp flashes of light and thousands of broken stars along with the fire! It's an absolute perfect balance between the white and fire! David sourced good stones! 

I am still blown away by David's artistry years later. I guess I never appreciated how complex my design really is not only with the pavé, but also the tri-gold! I've seen a similar ring to mine at a local jeweler but the pavé doesn't go all the way under the crossover, it's plain metal and one metal not 3. 

David masterfully filled the braided crossover bands with pavé so the bands look like a continuous string of diamonds wrapping my finger. It’s a 360-degree sculptural masterpiece! In 6 years I never lost a stone and that was without routine checks! 🫣

All that said there's a definite difference that the center now matches the setting. My band was always natural G melee. Before it always looked off but for awhile I didn't understand why. For me, it's the fast flashes that separate moissy to diamond.

However moissy isn't inferior just different. It is just more for rainbows even though I  specially picked an  H/A to tame the fire a bit for moissy!  I loved the space connection so I wanted to love it and convinced myself I did.The sparkle if a moissy is more slow and lazy bc of the double refraction. Moissy also has an almost constant glow, which is pretty in its own right, but mismatched for my band. 

I never thought I would swap for a lab even though David put that option 6 years ago! But I can't deny being more disenchanted with the ring and our 20th anniversary seemed like the proper time to fix that! So anyone on the fence with a lab go for it! And David is just chef's kiss to work with! 🤌",72,25,0.98,https://v.redd.it/avwquvt9krdg1

Long story short, we recently learned that the price to reset my 3/4ct (vg g vs2) natural diamond in a new band that I like and would have to be made for us would be $1600 more than the jeweler’s price to buy the same setting they have in the case for a 1.5ct stone because that one is priced at old gold pricing. Given the price difference, I’m playing around with the idea of finding a 1.5ct that could work with the one they have in-stock. So yeah, we are doing this backwards, but there’s several good reasons for doing so. 

Anyway, I have about $1500 to work with to source a stone. I’m guessing our best bet is to go with a lab created diamond, but I’m open to ideas. Like, could we maybe save money by buying a vintage oec stone?

My fiance proposed with a simple ring with the intention of having us go together to pick out what I would like. It was lovely and totally perfect approach for me. We had never discussed rings or getting engaged (but have been together for a long time). Was perfect how he did it. I’ll be honest, I was a little overwhelmed with all the choices when we went shopping. I have had NOTHING in mind, no dream ring or any idea what I was doing. I did know I wanted a “higher quality” ring all around vs just big carat size. I was so overwhelmed, I kinda just picked my fav after about 30 mins and thought I was really happy. It’s a cushion cut, 2ct, E, VVS2, lab diamond, pave, platinum ring. It’s really nice. I know that. But it feels a little like costume jewelry to me. And very very “high”. I was telling the jeweler that I wanted something low profile but she kept offering these solitaire presented options. I figured that’s what an engagement ring really is….

Anyway, I feel like it looks over the top for me personally. I don’t wear any jewelry except some simple daily gold hoops. So this suddenly feels very out of character. I still like it but I wish it was different. Do you think I should get a different setting?  There is technically a 30-day guarantee and I could make a change with no major financial impact but I’m conscious that my finance let me pick this out and am now questioning it….

Maybe I just need time to get used to a piece of jewelry???",76,52,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfqht0

1qfyvya,EngagementRings,lab grown diamond,1768710627.0,2026-01-18,2026,1,Is this a reasonable price for this size/style/etc.? Want to make sure I'm not being overcharged.,"Hello,

I need some expert advice on whether I am being charged too much for an engagement ring. I might be being too paranoid/untrustworthy, but I am on a budget and definitely want to get my money's worth for my lovely lady.

First, some backstory that I'll try not to keep too long. 

My girlfriend and I have been together since we were barely out of high school and are now in our mid-20s, so she knows she's going to be proposed to soon. We've talked marriage for years, just needed to wait to be more settled into adult life and ""ready.""

For that reason, she's given me a lot of information on what she wants in a ring and in fact, we went to a local independent jeweler today for a consultation -- she figured out exactly what style/size/etc. of ring she wants and then the plan was for me to work with the jeweler after to settle on the exact details, pricing, etc. so there's still some elements of surprise.

The jeweler texts me later about a 14-karat white gold ring with a 3.5mm domed band, set with a 1.50-2.00ct emerald cut lab grown diamond, which is exactly what my girlfriend wanted. However, she knows we're on a pretty tight budget and expects not to necessarily get the ""perfect"" ring -- but there are a few details I know are pretty non-negotiable, e.g. she definitely wants an emerald cut and a plain white gold band (lab grown was her idea, too, fwiw). So I don't want to make too many changes, but the jeweler says this would range from ""$2,900 to $6,300 plus tax."" Up until this point, my girlfriend is aware of the conversation and insists she doesn't want me to spend more than $1,500 -- which is pretty much the ballpark budget we previously selected. Apparently, her mom thinks this sounds way too expensive, too.

I start negotiating with the jeweler -- and at this point, my girlfriend isn't in the loop anymore, because we both don't want her to know all the details, like I said. I explain I'm shooting for $1,500, maybe around $1,800 (I'm realistically able to go up to $2,000).  I suggested maybe narrowing the band, since I'm pretty confident my girlfriend cares more about the diamond than the width of the band.

The jeweler says the same ring but in 10 karat white gold and closer to 1.50ct would be ""closer to the $2,300 mark.""  She says ""if we did a slightly thinner ring at 3.00mm in 10 karat white gold with a 1.50ct size, it would be around $2,000."" Finally, she suggests a ""2.2 mm wide band in 10 karat white gold at 1.50 ct"" is in the $1,700-$1,950 range.

I say I'm interested in the cheapest option, and she says she has a 10-karat white gold, 2.2 mm wide domed solitaire engagement ring, set with one 1.76ct, E color, Si1 clarity, lan grown emerald cut diamond in the size 10.5 for $1,886+tax.

Now, this seemed reasonable at first, but I did some online snooping and saw I could get pretty similar rings for under $1,500 and even near $1,000.

Am I being charged too much with this jeweler, or is it likely that the rings I saw online aren't quite the same/are perhaps worse quality? Like I said, $2,000ish is my max budget, so I can definitely purchase the $1,886 ring (I assume tax is just regular sales tax?), and I at least trust that this jeweler is good quality. And my girlfriend would definitely like it. 

But can I get more bang for my buck elsewhere? I'm aware my budget is hard to work with but I at least want to get the best ring I can with it. 

For more context, I don't have very many more options as I live in a small-ish city. One of the options is KAY which I've heard bad things about. Also, when I told the jeweler I need a few days to think, she said the price might change within a few days with the price of gold -- which I guess is reasonable, but I got a slightly bad vibe with the pushiness.

Any thoughts are appreciated, and I hope I don't offend any jewelers! I just really don't know what I'm doing.",3,8,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngagementRings/comments/1qfyvya/is_this_a_reasonable_price_for_this_sizestyleetc/

*One of a Kind Bricolage Ring No. 26*

$25,250.00

This one-of-a-kind ring has an impressive 2.18 carat recycled diamond with a medium open culet, which accentuates its “hall of mirrors” appearance. The two juxtaposing stones embody duality. Paired with this diamond is an Australian boulder opal which adds a mesmerizing play of color. This ring is handcrafted from Fairmined gold to support the communities at the source of our jewelry.

Details

* 14k solid Fairmined yellow gold
* Diamond, modified shield cut, 10.40x7.96x3.92 mm, 2.18ct, K SI1, GIA certified, reclaimed
* Boulder Opal, freeform cabochon, 10.3x4.46x1.99mm, 0.9ct, Australia origin
* 3.08 total carat weight
* Flat band approximately 6.5mm wide

Sourcing

This piece is handmade locally in New York, using a responsibly sourced [reclaimed diamond](https://wwake.com/pages/our-materials), an Australian opal, and 100% [Fairmined gold](https://wwake.com/pages/our-materials) which supports the communities at the source of our materials.

Care

Diamonds are durable by nature but still should be handled with care. Avoid harsh chemicals and extreme heat. If your stone needs cleaning, you can use a polishing cloth, dish soap, and a baby tooth brush to clean underneath the setting and bring it back to its original beauty. If you ever need a deep clean, feel free to email [customerservice@wwake.com](mailto:customerservice@wwake.com) and we can help with next steps.

While we love the brilliance of our opals, it's important to know that this comes hand in hand with the fact that they are a ""softer"" stone. In general, we recommend being gentle with your opal jewelry, follow these [general care tips](https://wwake.com/pages/jewelry-care), and be mindful not to hit them against something hard by mistake.

I made a post a while back about wanting to buy some diamond stud earrings, and in my search Idyl is one of the places that popped up. I really fell for the idea of modular ear pieces, especially since I have quite a few costume ear jackets that I have worn to death, and so I thought it’d be great to get some better quality ones that I could pair with my diamond studs. 

HOWEVER, I really hate the influencer marketing strategy of Idyl, and how everyone and their mother are pushing their pieces. It makes me wary, to be honest. I’m still not too familiar with the pricing of diamonds, but I keep reading on reddit how they are also very overpriced. Lastly, I am not crazy about bezel set stones, and would prefer a four prong setting for my studs, and I worry that wouldn’t be compatible with Idyl’s add on pieces. 

So, are there any other companies that does something similar that are just not popping up on my google searches? Is there any chance I could have something like this custom made (without having to sell my firstborn to pay for it)? I’m thinking lab diamonds, or even moissanite could be an option (or would that look off paired with the diamond studs?). ",6,5,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qh05e5

Thankfully not too big that it'd fall off, but it's pretty spinny and loose.

My fiance and I recently got our wedding bands over Black Friday and I love the design of mine. Though I'm worried that this set creates some sizing issues. 

The wedding band sits flush with my slightly-too-big engagement ring if I place them together, but they separate very easily.

Since the wedding band has a raised setting, I'm worried that downsizing my engagement ring will force the two rings further apart. Right now, my engagement ring being a bit too big allows it to rest on top of and ""lock-in"" between the individual diamonds on the wedding band. 

I plan to wear the rings separately at times so soldering isn't an option. But do any solutions come to mind that allow me to maintain this set and keep the two rings flush + downsize my engagement ring?

My question is, there is sort of a dark area when I turn it sometimes. Upper left corner. Is that an inclusion? Or, what is it?

I found a jeweler I really like and the experience has been great so far, but there’s one specific request they’re having a hard time with.

I’m trying to source 36 x 1.0mm round fancy light blue/aqua diamonds for a double pavé band, and I’d love for them to be mined in South Africa. We both live in the U.S., but she’s originally from South Africa, and having that detail built into the ring is really meaningful to me.

I don’t know much about gemstone sourcing — especially for tiny melee like this — so I’m not sure where to start. Who should I be talking to (suppliers, cutters, specific jewelers, etc.) or what keywords/certifications should I be asking for to make sure the stones are actually South African origin?

I was never an “engagement ring girl” - genuinely never saw a ring that I liked for me. Something about a diamond on a band just didn’t make me excited? And funny enough, I’d seen bezels before and I liked them even less than a non bezel setting. But somehow I found some inspiration and with the help of my best friend’s mom, a fantastic goldsmith - I now have my dream ring. For me what I think makes this bezel different is that it’s thicker, and the corners don’t follow the curve of the diamond but actually extend to emphasize more squared off corners? Honestly, who knows. I love that it feels classic, there’s more ring to it, and it’s not just a diamond on a band (which I will add; there’s nothing wrong with that! Just not for me.)

I know this ring isn’t for everyone, but I’m sharing because maybe this will help others who aren’t sure what they want !

I had a 1.1ct very included platinum engagement ring. The plan was to upgrade.  Big box store wanted $7k for a 4k lab diamond. So when I went to a mom and pop and they offered to reset my setting with a 4ct ideal cut lab for just $1500, and be done in an hour, I jumped at it. 

  
“set it very low” i asked. “it spins already and drives me crazy, so the lower the better. Also i am very allergic to gold. it must be platinum.”

They said “the prongs I have are white gold but it will be on Your platinum ring. Don’t worry.”

within 90 minutes they had set the diamond with massive prongs in 14k. I think there is gold where the prongs are set because my finger is already irritated where it sits, and the underside of the ring is scratchy. The ring overall feels pointy: like a German industrial building, when I wanted something like a Disney princess castle 🏰 but comfortable. 

I dont think that a super low setting was possible with the prong/head they had on hand. 

So what would you do? I’m inclined to start all over. The mom and pop was nice - they said they can continue to modify it but I’d prefer to not go back.  I think they do great on Price/speed but only ok on quality, and I’d rather have slow/quality optimized for this project.

The GIA report (attached) says ""Cushion Brilliant"" but from what I've googled that can happen based off of stone proportions so it could also be an elongated old mine (??pls correct me if I'm wrong). 

Is an antique cushion brilliant cut even a thing? 

I think it's important to clarify that love the stone regardless of these details, I'm just confused and am realizing that maybe I should have asked more questions. ",3,9,1.0,https://i.redd.it/lrbztld172fg1.jpeg

Its a fancy black natural diamond with GIA certification. But we noticed a visible surface crack on the stone (which was also confirmed by the jeweler). 

I'm concerned about the structural integrity of the stone, if it will be more prone to breaks or more cracks because of this issue. Is it also normal that a surface crack is not reported in the GIA? 

Is it okay to keep the stone, or better to replace with a natural, treated black diamond instead?

Everyone here has been so amazing &amp; helpful over these past months &amp; I can’t thank you enough!

While I’m American, my husband &amp; I live in France (in the Alsace Region) &amp; we are looking for a lab created (CVD) oval diamond.  While we have checked out many of the companies mentioned &amp; recommended in this &amp; other sub groups, we are wondering if anyone out there has dealt with a company that is in France or the EU?  This is because of the VAT.  No matter what type of deal we are finding on the usual suspects (rare carat, aureline, etc), at the end of the day, our cost increases 20% because of the VAT.  They don’t call it that, but it’s folded into the price that we’re finally quoted, after all is said &amp; done.

So, if anyone has anything helpful to say, we’d really appreciate the info!  We’ve been looking to upgrade my original ER for our 35th anniversary &amp; it’s taking way more time than we thought.  While I want it to be perfect, I’d also like to get it sometime this year!  Lol.

I’ve started contacting local jewelers for quotes on a custom engagement ring and have already seen some pretty high numbers — $3k+ for a setting and $2k+ for a lab-grown stone, which feels steep compared to online prices.

I did find a local jeweler willing to price match a stone I find myself. On our first call, he quoted a 2.0 ct GIA lab diamond described as *“single-seed / pure seed”* for about $1,250. He said multi-seed lab diamonds (often IGI certified) are grown faster and that IGI grading isn’t as strict as GIA. He *will* price match an IGI stone in my budget (\~$550 for a 2.0–2.5 ct emerald cut, D–F, VS2–VVS1), but warned quality may vary.

Here’s my dilemma:

* To me, a diamond is a diamond
* I don’t want something yellow or obviously bad
* My partner doesn’t care about size or price
* Total budget is $2k–$3k

So for those with experience:

* Does single-seed vs multi-seed actually matter visually?
* Is IGI vs GIA a real-world difference or mostly grading consistency?
* Am I risking an *ugly* stone by going with a cheaper IGI diamond?
* Or should I just buy the best-looking stone in my price range and stop overthinking it?

Any insight is appreciated — thanks.",0,17,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamonds/comments/1qkzeon/igi_vs_gia_singleseed_vs_multiseed_lab_diamonds/

I know the lighting and backgrounds in the videos are different, but the 2.35 HPHT seems to show a slight blue nuance (which I’ve heard can happen with HPHT). The 2.37 CVD appears a bit whiter to my eye.

The 2.37 costs about $200 more than the 2.35, which isn’t a deal breaker if it’s genuinely the better choice.

Has anyone here recently got a lab grown tennis bracelet from Kuololit? What was your experience like? Do you like it? If something isn't 100% with the bracelet, would I be able to take it to a jeweler here for cleaning/repair? I've literally never bought jewelry until this point in my life so I have no idea what I'm doing lol. But Kuololit is intriguing as the savings compared to buying locally would be almost 50%.

Also, on stone size, is 2.5mm or 3mm generally better? Like I want it to be able to be known that the bracelet has diamonds on it but I also don't want it to be too gaudy. I've thought about taking my fiancee to a jeweler to look at this but I want it to be a surprise.

1qn7ndt,labdiamond,lab grown diamond,1769406482.0,2026-01-26,2026,1,Lab diamond stores,"Edited to add more context.

I’m looking to purchase a 2-3 carat loose marquise cut excellent quality lab diamond OR possibly purchasing an entire ring, 14k yellow gold from somewhere.

I was at a mall chain jewelry store recently. They have a sale on lab diamonds from their newest jewelry supplier right now through February. We looked at a couple very good ones,  E VVS1 ideal cut 2 and 3 carat loose diamonds. Price ranged from $2500 to $3000 for them. I know that’s probably overpriced.

I have been looking online at various brands like rare carat, grown brilliance, brilliant earth, and brilliance. Prices seem to vary vastly for a comparable quality as I mentioned above- some less than the chain store, some comparable, some less. I don’t know what is fair/reasonable price ranges and what companies are reputable.

Also, My biggest concerns if I buy an actual ring online unseen in person:

Is if I will actually like it. And if not, can I return it?

If it gets damaged or if I lose a stone having to send it off for repair seems risky to get lost in the mail, whereas I can just drop it off locally.

The online retailers lifetime warranties are generally way more expensive than the price quoted at the mall chain jewelry store. For example, we discussed their lifetime warranty prices ranging from $200-350 lifetime and no mandatory ring checks; covers everything, including lost stones , repairs, buffing, polishing and sizing, etc. several others online are offering lifetime warranty for $500 plus. One even was nearly $1k.

Mine and my husband’s wedding rings are from the chain store. We have been married for 28 years, long before online shopping was a thing. I have other jewelry from there for the same reason.  We always buy the lifetime warranty.  I have always had good customer service and no hassle repairs. I have even had diamonds replaced in my wedding ring a few times. So I’m not concerned about the chain jewelry store not honoring the warranty. I’m concerned about buying online and how they seem to be charging way more for life time warranties. Also, the inconvenience of repairing it should it need repair.

I’m also not wanting to get ripped off online by overpaying for a lab diamond.

So, Where should I shop online? Why? And what are your experiences?

Thanks!

2nd Edit to add: I’m not committed to the chain store where I purchased before. That’s why I am asking for recommendations for other retailers.  My concern is protecting my purchase. If you have different suggestions than a lifetime warranty, or your own experience with repairs/costs elsewhere, I’d like to hear that too.",7,22,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/labdiamond/comments/1qn7ndt/lab_diamond_stores/

I guess my question is am I right in thinking that the i3 isn’t a big deal because it’s a darker color and it’s harder to tell? And is $1500 a good price?

I haven’t shopped for fine jewelry since 2018 when we bought wedding bands. 

We’ve explored resetting the original ring (top ring in the 2nd picture), but I’ve learned so much in here and discovered that the stone is not a great cut (it tends to “shrink” depending on lighting) so we are thinking of going for a bigger, better cut stone instead in the 1-1.5ct range, likely a lab stone due to price. One thing I know I want is a beautiful, firey, sparkly round diamond. It could be a solitaire or a 3-stone; could be an old European cut. Meanwhile, the price of gold is rising (again) and really eating up a lot of our budget. We’ve already had to scrap our plans once because we were quoted $4k to build a setting we liked.

The ring with sapphires was actually bought as a righthand ring, but I later discovered the 2 bands go well together.

That's way too much for me, I am clumsy and don't want something that I won't be comfortable wearing traveling or in the city, and I don't see the budget value for it at this time in our life (we're saving and wanting to renovate our home a bit). That money can best be used elsewhere now. In my head I thought a 200-500 euro ring from etsy. I would be happy with white gold and moissonite (I love white gold already because as it tarnishes over the years the colour suits my skin tone and then when I get it re-dipped it's like a new ring). How can I let him know I really want a cheaper ring and **I mean it**? Can you trust Etsy sellers? I see a lot of sellers from India - are they reliable? **I am lost. Please help me.** ALSO I am scared he spends too much on a ring I don't love and won't enjoy wearing daily. Historically he hasn't bought me jewelry my style. I love him till death do us part and he's my love forever, I just worry because I am picky about things I wear daily.

I was given/inherited a diamond tennis bracelet that is set in sterling silver but real diamonds.  Probably about 5cts. It was made in the 60s I believe. I am trying to decide what to do with it. Its a lovely bracelet but I rarely wear jewelry and nothing so 'flashy' and I have ethical concerns about the mining of the stones. My mother loves jewelry and plans to leave quite a bit to me so I have to decide what to do with it all.

Surely I wasn't the first to inherit potential conflict diamonds. Resetting the stone won't change their origin. What did you all do?

EDIT: I should include I am looking for options aside from selling, I have sold jewelry before and am not hard up for cash. Worst comes to worst I will keep in for my daughter, but I was curious what other folks are doing with diamonds they almost know are conflicted.

We had a customer recently who sent an offer for one of our brand new 1 of 1 rings (natural gemstone center natural diamonds 18k white gold mounting made by us In house)

The offer that she sent was a lowball offer - less than half the asking price - she also asked for the ring to be sized in her offer …. The offer she sent was significantly below cost 

We countered her offer by about 20% higher and said we would be happy to size the ring - this counter was just barely covering what the ring cost to make and cost of sizing (it was an older ring which has been sitting for some time so we were on getting rid of it at long as we could recoup our cost)

The lady then countered a lower price , which was r

10% higher than her original offer and still asked for sizing

We then countered the 3rd time at this same price but In the message told her (we can only sell this ring at this price without sizing) we are taking a slight loss on the ring at this point 

We also said that if she wanted sizing we could do it for $100 more

She accepted the offer and paid - and then in the note section of the offer wrote “thank you for sizing the ring” ….

But she did not pay the extra $100

So what would you guys do in this situation would you size the ring when you are already loosing about $200 on the ring , would you ship it without sizing which was the agreement on the offer she accepted 

Or would you cancel the order ? I am about to ship it without sizing it ,., we have been in this business for a long time and this is the first time something like this has happened you advise is greatly appreciated the transaction is on eBay ",6,15,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/1qolwry/customer_asking_for_additional_services_leaving/

I have seen the diamond in real life and it looked more reflective than the diamond it was compared to, however I am a bit skeptical that it was a fair comparison.

I was wondering whether more facets mean a better diamond than the standard 58?  And secondly, due to budget restrictions, whether it would be better to invest in better cuts or better clarity (VS 2 vs. VVS 2)?

I’m not sure if I’m expecting too much or this is the standard.

I’m looking for a specific style stone (antique cut oval in the G-I color range. Natural or lab, 1.5-2 carats) and my sales associate has lended very little help and really just told me to continually search their online inventory to see if anything I like comes in stock. She has sent me stones to look at twice over the last 3-ish months, but both times they were significantly out of my spec range (not antique cut, D color, or huge 3+ carat stones). TBH, it’s starting to turn me off from the design experience but I’m wondering if this is standard and I’m being too needy? I did expect her to go look for what I want instead of just telling me to browse their stock, as I’ve had other jewelers offer this in the past.

Update: Ken and Dana sent me a multi-page incredibly inappropriate and passive aggressive email scolding me for writing this post, which they seem to view as bashing them. TBH, I didn’t even read the whole email because it is insanely long (like unhinged ex gf long). From what I skimmed, they basically said “you complimented how through your design meeting notes were on 11/25 so you’re a liar that you’re unhappy and you don’t understand how hard were working behind the scenes!!!” (Which there is no way I believe that bc the SA just tried to push me back to a diamond I said was too white the day before I wrote this post) I don’t think this post was bashing them and I didn’t intend for it to be, but I can see why the unfavorable comments it garnered would upset them.

Please don’t tell me to go smaller. We are very set on a larger diamond. The first picture is the ring I loved on my finger when I tried it on. The second picture is my everyday ring on that hand. I’m accustomed to wearing a large pear shaped moonstone on that hand already &amp; enjoy that style.

My boyfriend &amp; I recently discussed marriage &amp; engagement. He wants to start shopping for a ring. Following this conversation I began getting a feel for what I want. After researching what I might want we used a day off work to visit local jewelry stores (limited selection because of our location) to try some on &amp; see how I actually liked the cuts/sizes on my actual hand with my other rings. Now I’m feeling very unsure about what I want &amp; limited on where to try on more large diamonds. Unfortunately only one store had 2 rings over 10 carats in our area. I loved the pear shaped 12 carat ring referenced in the first photo.

My questions are:

1. Where is a good place to buy 10+ carat loose diamonds online? Links to online overseas vendors? Auctions? I don’t want my boyfriend to spend a fortune on my ring. He can afford the retail price of the one I tried on but I don’t want him to pay it if we can help it. I’d rather have a beautiful ring we bought with a good deal &amp; still have money leftover for a down payment on our first home later.

2. Where is the best place in Houston to try on larger diamond rings or compare loose stones? We are willing to make the 4+ hour round trip drive on a day off but don’t know where to start. We don’t want to spend the whole day chasing down stores that don’t carry what we are looking for like we’ve done in our area.

3. Any recommendations for artists that create custom platinum rings here in the United States?

Big stones are fun! More stones is fun! However. They aren’t practical for me for everyday wear. With that being said, with the price of gold being so high, it’s not feasible to buy so many pieces, even though the stones are very affordable, for something I’m only wearing for occasions. It’s the settings that are so pricy! Many companies / vendors I have found label their jewelry as filled but it’s definitely only plated. Not stamped properly/chips easily. Yes 925 exists but I only wear yellow gold. 

I have several gold-filled items I’ve had for 25 years including a locket I wear every day / chains and they haven’t tarnished or worn off (I don’t shower with them or swim with them but have on occasion) so I think it’s probably durable enough to justify occasion wear. 

Is anyone aware of any companies / designers that sell gold-filled diamond/gem jewelry? Do we think vendors may consider offering this choice given the price of gold? I know I would buy more! 

I personally would love to support businesses offering this, and generally would pay a premium for the choice given the massive reduction in cost from solid gold. ",6,9,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/labdiamond/comments/1qpnptd/i_am_looking_for_goldfilled_lab_diamond_or_other/

I am trying to find any Chinesse vendor because it would be quicker to ship the diamond to the Provence.

I reached our so far to Loose grown diamonds (they are based in USA, and  said they can ship to China but without insurance, and they are not responsible if the diamond will be lost), and to Better Star (they said for 1 piece they cannot help me).

A few questions I had after reading the report and doing some research:

1) The comments mention additional twinning wisps, clouds, pinpoints, and surface graining not shown. How should I interpret that? Are twinning wisps usually not a big deal in VS2?

2) Based on the report alone, are there any red flags or follow-up questions you’d ask the seller?

I went to see both back to back today. I really like the first one. It looks a bit bigger, appears flashier, more elongated and very brilliant, but it has a couple marks given it’s an SI2 which are on the face of the diamond. I didn’t notice them at first but once I looked pretty close up I could see them with the naked eye. 

The second is very nice too. It feels like the safer pick. It’s a been more “rounded” cushion look which is less preferred but it’s quite minor difference in shape and still looks very nice. For some reason it didn’t have the same flash and “clearness” as the other but there were no noticeable imperfections to be seen by the naked eye. 

Price is pretty similar but the SI1 is \~10 percent more. 

I’m really having a tough time with this one. I like everything about the first one but am a bit nervous about my long term view on the imperfection.

Now that I actually have a proposal date I've started talking to jewlers in my area and would love some outside opinions.   
After my first few conversations with 4 different jewelers I decided on Ascot Diamonds. From what I've read here and other places they have a great reputation and incredible reviewes. As a twenty something college student I worried I wouldn't be taken seriously but Ascot were very informative and helpful even in the first call. Theor pricing was super reasonable comparatively and were super focused on making sure that I knew exactly what I was getting. I'm somewhat clueless about how everythings works other than what I've read here and in other communities so this was a pretty big indicator to me that this is the jewler I should choose.   
After our initial conversation they emailed me to ask if I'd like them to bring in diamonds for me to look at and mentioned that it might be worth spending a bit more on the stone. (my original budget was $400 for a 2.5 ct emerald cut) I replied that I would and haven't gotten a response yet (6 days). I sent a followup email letting them know that I was planning to take their advice and up my stone budget up by a decent margin.   
So my questions are   
Should I be concerned that I haven't heard back yet or is this normal?  
Has anyone else worked with Ascot Diamonds and can speak about their experince.   
Is there anything else that I should be doing at this point in the process? (timeline is about 4 months)

Can lighting, reflections, camera settings, or surroundings really cause such color shift and reflections?

I’m in the process of upgrading my engagement ring and would really appreciate some outside perspective. I’ve included photos of some the rings I’ve tried on and the general direction I’m considering. The last in the set is one the jeweler colored with a blue sharpie so we could visualize a sapphire. 

Originally, I thought I wanted a sapphire center stone (I love blue, especially deeper royal or slightly teal tones). I worked with a local jeweler on a custom ring idea: a sapphire center with diamond side stones. However, the natural sapphire options within my budget feel a bit smaller and less sparkly than I expected, and stepping up in size/color gets expensive quickly.

While shopping, I also tried on a few diamond rings (including some larger, very sparkly ones), and I was surprised by how much I liked them — especially a three-stone style that really feels like an “upgrade.” That said, I don’t want something that feels over-the-top or costume-like. I want this ring to feel real, high quality, and timeless, not just big.

My main questions:
Do you think a sapphire ring can still feel like a true upgrade compared to a diamond?

Do any of these settings stand out as more timeless or a better fit?

If you’ve upgraded your ring, what mattered more long-term: size/sparkle or meaning/stone choice? Any regrets? 

I dress pretty casually day-to-day, so I want something that feels special but still wearable and flexible.

What I love about the oval center stone (2.4 carat lab diamond) :I look at it and just think “wow”. The sparkle is beautiful in this ring, and it stands out without being overly flashy. I still think of it as a timeless, classy ring, just with more of a wow factor to it.

I reached out to Ouros, Provence, Tianyu, Starsgem and LGG. The difference in customer service from all the vendors versus Romy was stark. 

Romy was responsive, kind and knowledgeable. Never pushy nor demanding. The prices ranged from $1300-$2k+ for the same ring between the vendors. 

I sent my first email on Dec 28th and received the ring on Jan 29th (and that was after several delays due to bad weather!). All in all, great experience working with Romy and already itching to work together again for a new eternity band.

Hello,

I have a loose diamond I am considering selling, and would be grateful for advice or recommendations as to exactly how to go about it.  I'm afraid I don't know much about the trade.  I saw a reference in my search to Abe Mor, and it looks like they're still an option.  I know I could approach some local jewelers here in San Francisco - although I don't really feel qualified to gauge whether any single offer is fair.  Any other suggestions for how/where to liquidate this stone?

It's a 5.53 carat natural diamond, and has been GIA graded (I'll attach the lab report).  Round brilliant in shape, color grade L, clarity SI1, cut Good.

Many thanks in advance for any suggestions!

She’s Colombian, loves emeralds and doesn’t care much about diamonds. She generally avoids anything bulky and prefers jewelry that feels delicate and intentional. The center stone is a natural emerald (roughly 1.7ct). I'm choosing between two 18k yellow gold settings:

Option 1 (Round Clusters): Three small round brilliant diamonds on each side. I feel like the sparkle gives the emerald life and creates a more feminine, tapered silhouette.

Option 2 (Trapezoids): One larger trapezoid-cut diamond on each side. I’ve asked several of the women in my family and they all prefer this one. They said it feels more elegant. I want to make sure this is actually an aesthetically pleasing and beautiful ring, rather than just “bigger = this must be better”

For those of you who prefer a minimalist style, which one would you actually want to wear every day? Does the cluster look too busy, or do the trapezoids look too heavy? Above all else, I want the emerald to be the start of the show on this ring!

1qtijbd,EngagementRings,lab grown diamond,1769999154.0,2026-02-02,2026,2,Cullen Jewellery vs Novita Diamonds - My Personal Experience,"Hey everyone, I've noticed a few posts lately asking for comparisons/recommendations between Cullen Jewellery and Novita Diamonds, and it just so happens that I had made a comment on another post a few months ago sharing my experience.

Since both Cullen and Novita have showrooms in my city (Auckland NZ), both of which I have visited when shopping for my engagement ring, I thought this would be a great opportunity to share my reasons through personal experience.

We ultimately decided on Cullen Jewellery based on the my reasons below. I hope my comments can provide some help/insight to others deciding between the two 🥰 (have posted photos of my ring in the comments)

Craft: Cullen has their own in-house jewellers and are very transparent about their craftsmanship and quality control, and their team are full of people who take pride in their work. We felt like we could really trust them to get our ring right. I’m still unclear as to whether Novita has their own jewellers, or if they are outsourced (so sign of this on their website and socials).

Showrooms: The Novita showroom where I live is located in a shopping mall, with a wide open entrance and anyone can see you when they walk past. It just doesn’t have that premium feel compared to the Cullen showroom. At Cullen, you need to book an appointment to be able to visit the showroom. Their showroom is cozy and no one can just walk in, which makes the experience so much more comfortable.

Price/Production: When I was doing my research on where to buy our engagement ring, Novita just felt like a very mass-produced type company, like Brilliant Earth but with a few actual showrooms. I would say that there didn’t seem to be a massive difference in diamond prices between Cullen and Novita, if any.

Environment: This one is a big spiel so I apologies in advance!! One of the reasons we didn’t want a mined diamond is because, as both my fiancé and I are both geologists, we have some knowledge around the mining industry. When it came to diamonds, we just didn’t want to go there due to the harmful nature of the works to the environment (destruction of ecogical habitats/systems etc, risk to loss of human life during works etc). So lab it was. However, we both did our research (scientific pls, not just a google search 😭) on the impact of diamond production methods and carbon footprint. Lab grown diamonds obviously use up a significant amount of energy and contributes to production of greenhouse gasses, just in lesser quantities than that of mined diamonds. Now, Cullen and Novita both do lab diamonds. However, Cullen Jewellery has an initiative with Clear Neutral to offset their carbon footprint and Novita Diamonds don’t. We went with Cullen because we felt good about giving our money to a company that actually cares about the environment enough to do something.

Vibe: Each time I visited the Cullen showroom, the showroom assistant was so helpful and pleasant that it literally felt like I was just shopping with a friend! Novita was actually super helpful too, but I just couldn't get past the mall environment and it sort of felt like shopping at Michael Hill or Walker &amp; Hall.

I would love to hear everyone's experience, whether at Cullen Jewellery or Novita Diamonds!",4,7,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngagementRings/comments/1qtijbd/cullen_jewellery_vs_novita_diamonds_my_personal/

1quah90,Diamonds,lab grown diamond,1770072598.0,2026-02-02,2026,2,Grown Billiance *Not as brilliant as they seem BUYER BEWARE,"In 2023, I purchased an IGI Certified Lab Grown Diamond engagement ring from Grown Brilliance, featuring a Marquise Shaped, Excellent Cut, E-VVS2 stone. Although I initially had reservations about the main diamond's lack of brilliance, I didn't voice them as my partner was happy.



Unfortunately, the diamond soon began to appear cloudy, losing its clarity, while the smaller accent diamonds retained their sparkle. When I contacted the vendor, they recommended professional cleaning. The cleaning restored the brilliance, but only for one or two days before the cloudiness returned. A subsequent cleaning prompted the jeweller to express concern, noting this recurring issue was highly unusual. Because of its dull appearance, my wife became self-conscious and stopped wearing the ring, feeling it looked fake.



For our anniversary on December 1st, I asked her to wear the ring. Upon observing the cloudiness, we consulted a second jeweller. They cleaned the ring, but again, the sparkle faded within days. A follow-up visit led the jeweller to examine the certificate and confirm its authenticity. However, they concluded there seemed to be an inherent flaw, describing it as a ""low quality diamond, even by lab grown standards,"" suggesting a poor carbon composition.



I contacted Grown Brilliance again. They dismissed the issue, blaming external factors like oils and lotions. They argued the issue is not covered under warranty, claiming that since the diamond sparkles after cleaning, there is no inherent defect. This contradicts the fact that the wedding band and the accent diamonds remain brilliant. This situation has caused a significant financial loss and, more importantly, disappointment to my loving partner.

The stone itself is truly exquisite—perfectly colorless, internally flawless, and remarkably brilliant, exactly what you would expect from the very top of the color and clarity scales for lab-grown diamonds.

The certification was a precise 1:1 match with the diamond I received, which spoke volumes about the company’s transparency and quality control. Before placing my order, I did extensive comparison shopping and was surprised to find the same stone listed on another reputable website for almost twice the price, underscoring the exceptional value Loose Grown Diamond provides at their wholesale-style pricing.

From inquiry to delivery, communication was professional, timely, and courteous, reflecting the level of service one expects from a luxury jeweler. The diamond arrived securely packaged and beautifully presented, further enhancing the overall high-end experience.

This purchase has given me complete confidence in Loose Grown Diamond as a trusted destination for premium lab-grown stones, and I would not hesitate to work with them again for future pieces. Without reservation, I would rate my experience 10/10 and highly recommend Loose Grown Diamond to anyone seeking a luxurious, elevated diamond buying experience at a truly compelling price point.

I’m planning to go lab-grown, and I’m open to different settings, subtle design details, mixed textures, halos vs no halos, etc. Basically just looking for ideas, photos, designers, or things you wish you had thought about when choosing your rings.

At the end of December 2025 the online price tracker showed it was at $5999 but now it's back to $7500. 

It says on zales website that the center stone is 5 ct. I've yet to find any graduated band and setting exactly like this anywhere I've looked but just started my search today. I want a ring that looks like this as closely as possible but am not sure what to expect on total savings by not going to Zales.

I'm willing to shop band and stone separately and have a local jeweler set the center stone if it saves money. Again, I'm just now scratching the surface on this search. 

I found a 5.11ct, E/VS1 with IGI certificate at Loosegrowndiamond for $1917 before tax

Or a 5.09 ct, F/VVS2, no certificate, for $1615 on the same site just as another option. 

I really don't know how to make sure it's going to sparkle like the one in the store did. Their lighting in store makes a difference, I'm sure. 

Does having a certificate really make a big difference? In what ways? I don't intend to resale but I guess I don't know for sure what the future holds. 
I really just want this ring for the best deal possible and would appreciate any guidance. It will be a gift to myself. ",1,38,0.56,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qudzu1

I got engaged recently and I'm genuinely so happy and excited to marry my fiancé. 

But I'm struggling a little with some feelings and could use some perspective/advice from people who've been here.

The ring is from Brilliant Earth (lab-grown diamond). I had mentioned to him beforehand that I'd seen mixed/negative reviews about their quality and customer service (things like loose stones, prong issues, slow repairs). He went with it anyway, honestly probably for convenience. The ring looks beautiful right now, but I'm anxious about long-term durability based on what I've read (recent Reddit threads mention stones loosening after light wear, prongs failing, etc.). Has anyone had good/bad experiences with their settings holding up over time? Or tips for getting it checked/insured early? I’m trying not to be upset about this but it’s been really discouraging seeing the BE hate.

1qukpcq,jewelry,lab grown diamond,1770100640.0,2026-02-03,2026,2,Michael Hill Australia,"Alright, this is a long one... 

In June 2025 my husband purchased my ""upgraded"" engagement ring from Michael Hill Australia (lesson learned, I will NEVER buy from a chain store again...). An oval 1.07 ct, VS2 I coloured lab diamond in a 14k white gold solitaire setting. Super pretty. My husband said they had it ""hiding under a counter out the back"", so I was a little suspicious but whatever- shiny diamond! It was $2.6k AUD if that matters, plus the $600 ""care"" plan (lol).  
  
Within 6 weeks it required rhodium plating... now, I was wearing the ring with my 14k wedding band. No mixed metals. I am very gentle on my hands, I take my rings off for everything I should (showering, cleaning, exercise etc). I do not work in a physically intense job (tourism), and I take excellent care of my rings. I am not an inexperienced jewellery owner.   
We took the ring back to MH, explained the situation and the ring was sent off for it's first rhodium plating. It returned 2 weeks later. I wore it sparingly, only for special occasions (3 weddings, a couple of date nights), in fear of damaging it. Well evidently that wasn't good enough and the ring started to appear the same as it did previously. By December it was back to looking janky. Like faded, unpolished tungsten. 

I took the ring in, expecting to have a chat with a staff member about my ring and why this was happening, and hopefully find a resolution. I know white gold develops patina, however it was barely 6 months of ownership and the ring was proving impossible to wear daily. I walked in to the store in a great mood (it was December, and as a gal who's worked in retail during peak seasons- I truly get how stressful it can be, and I want to be the easy customer), and noticed a woman sitting down looking at her hands behind the counter. She did everything she could to avoid my gaze, but she eventually stood up and right off the bat she was rude, snarky and inconvenienced by me asking for help. Long story short, she refused to look up any of our information in her system, refused to look at the ring and- of course, blamed me for the state of my ring. I tried so hard to be polite and explained the situation but she just wasn't having it. She told me that the best she could do was polish the ring. It wasn't so much the things she said, but HOW she spoke down to me. I felt absolutely embarrassed and honestly, pretty angry. I left the store but returned to grab the staff member's name so I could be sure to get my complaint as accurate as possible. Long story short, the store manager phoned me a few days later and made excuses for the staff member (apparently, the offending team member had recently had a car accident and a bout of ""bad luck""...) but ALSO said she lied to me and that this could have been resolved, the team member just didn't want to. She asked where I worked and if that could've dictated how she treated me (I work in a very niche department of tourism and see thousands of people per month but I had never once seen this woman). Anyway, we took the ring back in January for another rhodium plating. The manager pretended she didn't remember me or my complaint. But whatever. The ring was sent off. 

I was really, really over it all by the time I got this ring back last week. I was done with this whole saga and decided to try and sell the ring privately. Now- the absolute f\*cking KICKER, the reason I'm posting this at all-   
I took pictures of the ring. I took pictures of the IGI certificate and the MH certificate of ""authenticity"". I then look closer to make sure everything matches, and I notice the IGI number on the actual IGI document is different from the number on the MH certificate. By one digit. Ok, no worries, human errors happen... until we look a bit closer and I see the carat, colour and clarity are ALSO different on the MH cert! The MH cert lists it as being an SI clarity and J colour 1.00 carat, not the 1.07ct, I colour VS2 clarity that it actually is. There is also an awful oil-slick finish on the ring, not just where the ring was fading initially, but up the sides of the shank too. They haven't bothered polishing it before returning it to me. It looks terrible.   
  
Absolutely fuming. I now have a ring that I cannot sell privately, and also cannot wear. The MH team have not offered any resolution or taken any action outside of ""it's been forwarded to our regional manager"" after 4 days of begging for rectification. So, 2 rhodium platings, a shit experience and a fake certificate of authenticity all within 8 months. 

Anyway, don't buy from these absolute scammers.   
(I have thankfully since found the ring of my dreams that has been a true delight to own and wear, from a small Aussie business).

1qvxy28,labdiamond,lab grown diamond,1770232635.0,2026-02-04,2026,2,Hex pendant from LGG,"**Backstory:**

I love hexagons, but I don't love step cuts. I've been fixated on the idea of a hexagonal pendant for a couple of years and have been slowly saving up. It's nearly impossible to find someone in the U.S. to custom-cut diamonds, but I knew the overseas vendors had a better infrastructure in place to do so. 

I'd previously purchased the 14k bezel earrings from LGG and found them to be of amazing quality. I reached out to Lynn at LGG on December 10 to see if it would be possible to create a 14k bezel pendant that wasn't step cut. Suffice to say, she more than delivered.  

We went through a few CAD iterations because I wanted a chunky bezel but didn't want one that was too close to the double-bezel pendants I'd seen online. After Lynn and the CAD designer endured too many of my bad Canva mock-ups, we settled on a shadowbox-style bezel. I'm obsessed. My pendant arrived safe and sound on February 3. 

**Quality:**  
Supurb. The design is hollowed out to save on gold, but the bezel itself is thickly constructed and won't dent or bend. And it feels heavy in hand, clocking in at 3.4g. I also find that LGG's yellow gold has a slightly richer tone than some of the other overseas vendors. 

**Cons:**

This has nothing to do with Lynn or the pendant itself, but I'm worried that it's almost too big?? It's a statement piece for sure, but I don't often attend fancy events, and it's extremely blingy! I asked for a 7mm stone, and it ended up being 2.14ct and 7.8mm in the end. With the bezel, it's just bigger than I thought it'd be. A first-world problem.

Does anyone else struggle with this? How are we confidently rocking our huge lab diamonds without fear of judgment? I guess I just need to dig deep and own it. It's an heirloom piece for sure, and working with Lynn was a dream.

**Timeline &amp; Shipping:**

Reached out to Lynn: Dec. 10

Test cut (on moissanite) completed on Dec. 16

Diamond completed: Dec 29

CAD design: Ranged from Jan. 5 to Jan. 10 because there was some iteration

Pendant completed: Jan. 19 Lynn caught a small scratch on the side on the 20th, so she sent it for polishing and additional QC. 

Pendant shipped: Jan. 31

Pendant received: Feb. 3

Specifically I ordered an earth-mined diamond (1.16 carat, J, VS2) for $1.5k that has a slightly large table (59.5), a slightly steep crown (36 angle) and slightly shallow pavilion (40.5 angle). But my understanding is that a slightly steep crown can help offset a slightly large table and a slightly steep crown and slightly shallow pavilion can help offset the other's deficiencies (other relevant dimensions include 61.4 depth; slightly thick girdle; 41.5% pavilion depth; 14.5% crown height; 78% lower half; 49% star length; and pointed culet). 

Obviously this skews a bit shallow, but can these proportions help each other with overall effect? i know  some concerns include fish eye, leakage, and possibly more fire at the expense of brightness because of the crown (which fire-balanced isn't a deal breaker for me!). I know a diamond IRL will look different than how it comes across in a 360 degree view online, but as far as i can tell, there aren't issues with fisheye effect but i'm just a layman so my eye isn't as keen as those who are actually trained! everything i've written here is based on what i've read in this sub and other diamond resources! 

Ultimately, I am not chasing perfection (impossible, obviously!) and am fine with a ""very good"" cut at the end of the day.

I can’t see the stone in-person before it’s set because the ring is made in a facility overseas. She is local though.

I got engaged in September and had the opportunity to fully customize my engagement ring. I’ve had it for about three months now, and while it has definitely grown on me, something still feels a little off.

I knew I wanted a marquise diamond with a thicker band, but I emphasized multiple times that I still wanted the overall look to feel dainty, especially the basket. I chose the diamond myself and absolutely love it, but the gold on the ring feels much chunkier than I envisioned. Overall, this feels like a communication issue. Maybe I wasn’t firm enough, or maybe they didn’t fully listen, but I did use the words “dainty” and “delicate” several times throughout the process.

We’ve kept our engagement mostly private, sharing it only with immediate family. We’re planning a courthouse wedding and surprising friends and extended family afterward. While I’ve loved having this time feel intimate and stress-free, it also means I haven’t been able to show the ring to friends and get honest, unfiltered feedback.

I’m looking for genuine opinions, whether you love the ring or hate it, I want to hear it. If you were to change anything, what would you change, and how would you communicate that to the jeweler? The few people who have seen it think it’s beautiful, so I may just be in my head.

One more question: I’ve had the ring in my possession for exactly three months as of tomorrow. Is it too late to go back to the jeweler and request changes?

We’re getting married in just over two months, so I’m starting to feel the time crunch if I decide to move forward with any modifications.

My wife already wears:

	•	A white gold solitaire engagement ring with a 1 ct natural diamond (picture)

	•	A simple 2 mm yellow gold wedding band

The new ring would be worn alongside these, so it needs to work visually with both, while still feeling special.

**I’d love it if the design could reflect the idea of our twin daughters somehow.**

We’re not looking for a commercial ring as it will be fully custom-made by our jeweller. I’m mainly after concepts, inspiration, and advice on what works well in a stack like this.

Thank you for your support! Any idea will be appreciated!

It doesn’t look like a typical oval brilliant, but it’s also clearly not a crushed ice oval.

My eyes continued to go straight to it. With some research I found the ideal range of specs for a radiant like its table, depth, girdle and even looking for the 1 out of 7 radiants with long pavilion mains. 

I found this diamond and I was so excited as it fit all the ideal spec ranges and looked bright with no issues of any bowtie. Now that I have it I’m unsure if I love it or not, I keep going back in forth between love and disappointment. Let me break down why-

This is clearly a hybrid- leaning crushed iced radiant with its appearance but still having long pavilion mains. I didn’t know this was a thing when I purchased it. I thought because it had long pavilion mains in the report that it would be a traditional cut. I don’t know how to feel about it. When I searched crushed ice ovals in the past I wasn’t a fan, to me it screamed that it was a moissanite. I am fine with everyone knowing this is a lab diamond but I don’t want this to be mistaken for a moissanite. I dont have a specific preference on the cut but I don’t want it mistaken for anything other than a lab diamond. Without this diamonds information does it look like a crushed ice cut or clearly a hybrid? 

I’ve spent so much time searching for my perfect diamond and I don’t want to settle for anything other than a WOW diamond. I want something that is above average in appearance. It might be silly but this is important to me after all the time I’ve put into this and I’ve waited 10 years for this. 

With everything laid out, if you were me, would you keep this or continue the search? Does it appear to be a complete crushed ice cut? Would this catch your eye in person or is it just an average radiant diamond. Thank you!!!",28,23,0.92,https://v.redd.it/w37f0km1mxhg1

1qxu03j,jewelry,mined diamond,1770412156.0,2026-02-06,2026,2,Diamond replaced with lower quality?,"Hi all, I took my beloved engagement band in to the local jewelry store where we purchased it to get it reinforced. (I had a couple small diamonds fall out, and they explained that they would add basically another thin gold band to the inside of my existing band to make it stronger and hopefully help with the smaller half-halo diamonds falling out.)

When I was paying for the repair, one of the associates said they had ended up using a different small diamond in my band, and that the jeweler had put the original small diamond from my band into a baggie for me to keep. However, before she could give it to me, another associate took it and said they were not allowed to give extra diamonds to customers and that it must’ve been a mistake. I thought that was strange, but my ring looked fine, so I tried to just give them the benefit of the doubt — surely mine had been replaced with something of equal or greater value…

The next day though I saw that one of the diamonds is darker than the others. It had taken a couple weeks longer than expected for them to finish the repair, and when I picked it up I was just so happy to have it back I didn’t notice anything was wrong.  I called the owner and he said that some of their polishing cleaner might’ve gotten underneath the diamond and made it look darker?

I am also a little concerned about the very small holes in the gold that I’m seeing on the band… is this rushed/bad jewelry smithing, or nothing to worry about?

It would change my life, along with the fact that my mother loved rings. I also remember a museum collection of colored diamonds.

I am lucky enough to have 3 natural diamond rings but who doesn't want more. For awhile I was collecting Moissanite but there is a visual difference and it's not a diamond. Along came Lab diamonds and then their drop in price. I posted a few rings here in 2024 and some people asked to see my collection and as of now this is how it stands. I have 1.19 carats to 6.25 carats. I have every white color from D to N except for M and I have examples of my 6 favorite cuts, Round, Pear, Cushion, Oval, Princess and my favorite, Radiant. I have an Intense Greenish Blue in here and an Intense Yellow and Pink that I haven't had set yet. I have Intense Yellow side Pears flanking an elongated Radiant.

I've used lab grown emerald, ruby and sapphires as side stones along with natural green garnet which is Tsavorite. I've kept my costs low in 2 ways. I always buy the main lab first. The most important thing is to get the IGI certificate # and search it as one single diamond can be thousands of dollars difference from one site to the next. 

Once I have the stone I then scour the internet for setting inspiration. As I'm sure everyone knows Lab Diamonds are so much cheaper than natural that the real expense here is the setting. All of my settings here are 14k except the top row is Platinum. I LOVE Platinum. All of the settings pictured except the one in the very lower right I had custom made through Cherry at Fayjewelry. None of these settings were over $1000 although the price of Gold and Platinum have greatly increased since 2024. There is no design I have sent her that she has not been able to make. When I receive the setting I then have a local jeweler set it.

I'm planning on proposing to my partner in a couple months and currently shopping for an engagement ring.

I wanted to do a quick sanity check from people who know jewelry better than I do. I’m looking at this engagement ring on Etsy (simple signet-style setting with a lab-grown diamond). 

https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/4433505330/1-carat-emerald-lab-grown-diamond-signet

After messaging the seller, they offered to make it in Pt950 platinum for roughly the same price as their 14k gold option.

 I always thought platinum rings were noticeably more expensive than gold (especially 14k).

The seller says this is just their workshop pricing and that platinum isn’t much more costly for them. They seem legit otherwise and are responsive, but I’m trying to understand:

\- Is platinum ≈ 14k gold pricing ever normal with overseas / Etsy jewelers?

\- Could this be a legit wholesale/manufacturing thing, or is it a red flag?

\- Anything specific I should confirm (ring weight, Pt950 stamp, etc.) before proceeding?

I’ll be paying through Etsy checkout, but would love to hear from anyone who’s seen similar pricing or bought platinum from Etsy sellers.

Thanks!

I love green, love emeralds but have only been able to afford Lab created emeralds. I love emeralds with inclusions and they are now grown with inclusions but not enough for me.

My birthstone is garnet and 2 types of garnet come in Green. This is a 3.57 carat Natural Untreated Tsavorite or Green garnet. It has the look of a Natural Columbian Emerald but it wasn't thousands of dollars, I bought it from a dealer in Sri Lanka on Ebay for $256 total after bargaining with him. He has a 100% rating and 1500 sales at the time so I trusted I would get a nice stone and I'm in love with it. Like Emeralds it is common for large Green garnets to have inclusions. While I already have many Lab diamonds which I love, this is Natural and certainly a unique choice I think. Plus it's my birthstone. And I got my green center.

I have an entire folder of settings I love and can't afford. I knew what setting I wanted for this stone but it's well over $11,000 and had some things I wanted to change. I wanted a heftier setting, Radiant sides instead of Emerald and I wanted Platinum. This is where FayJewelry came in. I have used them for at least a dozen rings in both 14k and platinum in the past and Cherry, who I work with, created this Platinum, kind of vintage look with Lab Diamonds for $1465. It was created in about 3 weeks. All hand carved and hand milgrain. The side radiants are about .8 carat total and about 5x3mm. The ring without center stone weighed 8.54 grams.

I had a local jeweler set the center stone, which is more delicate than a diamond, for $50. The finished ring cost $1771, which I am in love with and is exactly what I pictured in my head. In real life the green almost glows against the bright diamonds and Platinum. I have other 3 stone rings but this is the first time I had FayJewelry supply the main side stones and I'm extremely happy with their quality. Cherry told me they use only D E and F in their lab diamonds.

If you want something other than a Diamond Center for your engagement ring there are many good dealers online. Always check reviews and ratings. I have had a bad encounter with Gem Rock Auctions and would not buy from them again.",15,11,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qzac7t

I just wanted to start off by thanking everyone on the subreddit. The help, advice and support I received was beyond invaluable especially since I’m new to all of this.

My wife and I have been together for a little over five years now and just got married at the end of last year. I started the process of looking for an engagement ring at the beginning of last year and just wanted to share my journey and experience with everyone!

My fiancée at the time asked me to design and build her a custom ring. I knew she wanted something simple, yet elegant, but also personalized to her. I was attentive to what she’d say about rings and careful with my questions, but learned she loved yellow gold and both oval and elongated cushions

I almost exclusively do all of my research here on Reddit 😂 So I did the same for her engagement ring! There’s so much information everywhere about anything and everything

I eventually stumbled across r/BestLabDiamondPricing and met u/shelikessparkles who helped me find the perfect diamond. She was extremely helpful and so knowledgeable! She found me the most rounded elongated cushion I’ve ever seen!

While also looking for someone to set the diamond, the name David Klass came up several times. I reached out and had u/shelikessparkles ship the stone to him directly! We were able to work together to design the setting completely customized to a specific size, width and thickness for both bands

These entire journey has been an incredible experience and wish anyone else going through this process the best! Please let me know if you guys have any questions! Thank you!

My ring was made by a fantastic jeweller in the US and I live in Canada. I've had the prongs tightened twice: once by the original US jeweller and once by a local jeweller. I'm wondering if it really matters who services my ring in the long run. Shortly after I received my ring back from the original jeweller, I was unfortunately very clumsy and dropped my ring on my tile floor which caused the stone to loosen again a bit which is why I sent it another time to a local jeweller. I was a little surprised that the stone loosened after 1 fall, but I also know rings are fragile. At the same time, I didn't experience loosening until a year an a half after the service done by the local jeweller.

It's time for my prongs to be tightened again and I don't know who I want to do the work. It's hard not to feel a little anxious sending my ring over seas for around 2 weeks. However, I would imagine that the jeweller who made it would have all the background info on it and therefore understand how to service it best. The original jeweller also serviced my ring for free, I just paid initial shipping and insurance (at the time I didn't know some jewellers cover that).

I’m so excited to share my custom lab diamond eternity band — I’m absolutely obsessed with it. 😍

This was my first time working with an overseas vendor, and I honestly couldn’t have asked for a smoother experience. I’ve read amazing things about Paston Jewelry, and Joyce in particular, and she completely lived up to the hype. Her English is excellent, communication was effortless, and she really guided me through some of the final decisions.

When I first reached out, Joyce sent several videos and photos of other projects to help me visualize options. I originally wanted a shared prong u-setting, but we ended up going with a split prong design with double gallery, where each diamond has four individual prongs. I was very particular about height, spacing, and comfort, and Joyce made sure the diamonds were set as low as possible — it’s super comfortable to wear.

I wanted something substantial enough to wear on its own, but that would also pair beautifully with my engagement ring. My engagement ring is set very low, so I knew there would be a gap, and Joyce made sure I understood that. I love how the two work together — it gives the set a modern, effortless feel without looking mismatched.

Some specs:

* **Diamonds:** Emerald cut, 3x4mm each
* **Number of diamonds:** \~20
* **Metal:** Platinum
* **Height:** \~2.8mm
* **Ring size:** 5 (I usually wear 4.75, but went up for width)
* **Engagement ring for reference:** 4.13ct elongated cushion

**Timeline:**

* **Jan 14:** First contacted Joyce
* **Jan 21:** Paid $100 CAD design fee
* **Jan 22:** First CAD received, tweaks made
* **Jan 23:** Final CAD confirmed
* **Jan 25:** Paid remainder and production began
* **Feb 2:** Ring ready — Joyce sent videos to confirm details
* **Feb 4:** Ring shipped
* **Feb 8:** Received! (in Canada)

Honestly, the process was smooth, and I couldn’t be happier with the result. It’s exactly what I hoped for — sparkly, elegant, and a little extra without overpowering my engagement ring.

I would like to go in armed with a little info so I know what to ask about as I am a little lost.

My original ring was a 1.01ct Pear G VS2 natural diamond

I would like to replace it with a different cut so I don't think too much about the ring I lost which was sentimental and I am considering an elongated cushion. I am going to go natural I think

I am just hoping for the most bang for my buck I can see the natural diamonds listed on their website and I know the amount the insurer has provided them I have to allow a little for the setting (plan on getting a very basic setting as I am not in a position to add to the cost and may be in the future and would like to maximise diamond value)

My priorities are sparkle and size I guess the colour and clarity were not that brilliant on my original diamond so should I just hope for a similar sized one in a different cut with the same specs?

I’m a woman dating a woman, and I’m starting to plan a proposal for my girlfriend. I want this to be incredibly thoughtful and meaningful, and I’d really love some woman-to-woman advice, especially from other women who’ve been proposed to (or have strong opinions 😄). The only direct info that she has given me on this topic is that she wants white gold and something shiny. She does not care about diamonds and prefers moissanite.

A few things I’d love input on:

	•	How would you want to be proposed to by another woman?

Private vs public, big romantic moment vs something intimate and low-key — what would genuinely make you feel loved and seen?

	•	What kind of engagement ring would you want to receive?

I’m personally leaning toward an emerald-cut ring, but I’d love to hear what styles you love (stone size, band style, solitaire vs accents, lab vs natural, etc.).

	•	Where would you recommend purchasing an engagement ring?

Online retailers, local jewelers, queer-owned businesses, or custom designers — I’m open to all suggestions and would love to hear about your experiences.

If you’ve been engaged, married, proposed, or are just someone who knows exactly what you’d want, I’d really appreciate your perspective. I want this to feel intentional, loving, and true to us, not just something done “because that’s how it’s usually done.”

How low can they go ?,"When Lab Diamonds were first introduced they were barely cheaper than Natural, only about 15% and they have steadily dropped since. Today you can find lab diamonds at 90% to 99% cheaper than their natural counterparts.

When I had my 6.25 carat ring made in early 2024 it cost me about $3700, the warm stone was $2500 of that and was a bargain back then. Although the price of Platinum has taken off I could buy a 6.32 carat G color VS1 Pear today for less than $1200, or less than half of what I paid a few years ago. BTW, researching it, a 6 carat Natural G color runs from $121,000 to $165,000.

All of this leads me to ask, how low will they go ? All I have ever read is that Lab Diamonds are not an investment, but I've never bought them for that. But will they someday be Cubic Zirconia prices?

Does their great drop in price give you pause in buying them? Natural diamonds have supposedly dropped too, but I still find them way too expensive. Recently I've started buying natural semi-precious stones like Garnet to create rings with, while using lab diamonds as sides.

Another sign that Labs have maybe become too cheap is seeing 2 carat Labs given away for free with the purchase of a setting from the way too expensive top jewelry design houses. Of course their settings are $5000 to $15000 to begin with but a Free 2 carat giveaway with the purchase of a setting makes a Lab diamond seem as valuable as glass. 

Any thoughts ? Is the drop in value disappointing ?",143,497,0.73,https://i.redd.it/gfas4xnt8oig1.jpeg

My box also didn't even come taped, wide open in delivery room. I initiated the return process for both mine and hers.

I absolutely want to establish I am over the moon with my fiancé and extremely grateful for the ring he designed for me. However, I have some questions and want to be as informed as I can be when we take it back to the jeweler together. My fiancé is extremely understanding and wants to do whatever to ensure the ring is perfect. 

My biggest concern is how high the stones are set. I am a veterinary technician and wanted a split shank kite set asscher based on this Frank darling ring: https://frankdarling.com/engagement-rings/the-symphony-asscher/

I am not a regular ring wearer and comfort/stability was one of my biggest requests for a ring and I absolutely fell in love with the setting from Frank darling. 

He opted to purchase the stones separately and have a jeweler make this ring custom rather than purchase from Frank darling which is completely fine.

I love my ring, I really do. However, I think I had a perfect image of the ring from Frank darling and when I immediately saw my ring I had some concerns. 

I don’t understand why the setting is set in partly in silver and not fully in gold. My finance says the jeweler told him silver would reflect the diamond better rather than gold. Is that true? 

I have not seen many rings with the square edges on the band, is that for a specific reason?

Based on the final product, is it reasonable for the side stones to be set in more? They are quite high for me and are rubbing on my fingers.

I’m honestly hoping to have the entire top part redone in gold, with claw prongs etc…basically more in line with the ring from Frank darling. 

If you’ve made it this far, you’re probably rolling your eyes and thinking he should have just purchased the ring from Frank darling. Perhaps, but he found an incredible lab grown diamond and wanted to use it. 

Thanks for any advice! I am nervous to navigate making edits to this ring because I do not want to insult my finance or the jeweler, but I also want to be completely 100% in love with my ring. ",67,13,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r1i71y

I have recently started looking at rings since my boyfriend and I have been dating a little over two years. it’s time for me to start looking! I saw a green diamond ring and instantly fell in love. I have been looking for a few months now and haven’t really loved a ring until a saw a green diamond. now I am obsessing over them and i’m even more excited for the day to come! with that being said, does anyone have any recommendation on where I can find a lab grown green diamond? I like the lighter ones better that have more of a yellow tint rather than the blue tint. i want it to be subtle but noticeable if that makes sense. i’m looking for 1.5-3 ct. budget is 5k for the whole ring, diamond and setting. I also like the radiant cut but am open to looking at others. (I still need to go and try on the different styles). any help would be appreciated! I am very new to this so if you have any recommendations about anything at all, please let me know!! thanks in advance!

I'm looking to get an engagement ring for my partner. I have chosen to speak with Taylor and Hart as they had similar designs to what I wanted. Has anyone had any experience with them?

I've got a radiant cut in mind, with an 18k yellow gold pave band which is 2mm, with the radiant lab diamond being in the region of 3.5ct ratio somewhere 1.35-1.4 ish, so it's a bit more elongated with platinum eagle prongs. I like that you can choose the birthstone which is a nice extra.

The render is of their original style but has a 1.6mm band, but I think with the style of diamond, a 2mm would provide better durability and aesthetics to the overall ring. I have a feeling it will run me in the region of 5k so obviously want to get it perfect.

I noticed they also do a diamond price guarantee but don't show you the IGI certificates prior to purchasing. Has anyone got any advice on that also?

I'm hoping to buy a \~1 ct round solitaire lab diamond (color: EF, clarity VS or better) pendant (pendant only, no chain) set in either sterling silver or 10k white gold, with a 4 claw prong setting (something like the photo attached). I asked a company I've worked with before, and they quoted me $310 for the sterling silver and $465 for the 10k white gold. I bought a 1.5 carat fancy cut pendant in 10k gold from them in December for around $360, so I think the price increase is a bit steep.

**EDITED** \- To add the ring was insured for replacement value (it was reassessed every year I had paid insurance for about 12 years) the value was 7-7.4k USD (I am in Australia so 10-10.5k here I just converted as I think most responders are US). I had to go to a jeweller I could not accept a pay out I could chose a preferred jeweller so I opted to go back to where it was made. 

The only option was to go to a jeweller to have one made up no payout option (fair enough) and I did want it replaced of course but it limited my options as far as how I could go about replacing it. I probably would have chosen to go and get a vintage or antique piece maybe not even a diamond.

I returned to the jeweller who made the ring. I had been hoping to upgrade at some point but I don't have the funds to do so so was just going to replace it with perhaps a different shape but basically like for like

However after speaking to the jeweller and mentioning I was hoping to upgrade to something in the future I have waked away having agreed to a lab ring.

It is a trilogy ring centre radiant cut 4.01 D colour VVS 1 and two side radiants 1.02 each D colour VVS1 set in a platinum setting. The band is 3mm thick and it is a cathedral setting

It has been ordered but not created as yet and if I knew it was of a similar value I would be happy but I am worried after reading this forum that perhaps I have made a mistake?

I know natural diamonds are not worth the retail price either and that I can't hope to get the same value from a store front as I see people get online here for their lab stones but I am just wondering if I would have been better off with the payout to the jeweller by going with the natural diamond.

I guess I am just hoping I haven't made an error by seeing the gorgeous larger stones and going that route",0,42,0.25,https://www.reddit.com/r/labdiamond/comments/1r2qcza/insurance_replacement_concerned_i_made_a_mistake/

I originally made this post to give credit to a company who acquired a loose stone I found with the EXACT specs I was looking for. I'll just keep this as is no fluff and just giving my experience to help others who are shopping loose lab grown diamonds.



I had already come here before asking about a 3 CT radiant cut I bought from LGD(Loose Grown Diamond). At first, the 360 video had me a little nervous as you can see from my older post back in November.



I literally searched up and down using filters for exact specs for a diamond to find a ratio of 1.25-1.29, good table and depth etc. I originally placed 3 orders with Ritani, all of which were canceled. They DID reach out to me asking if they could help me acquire a stone.



The specs on each of the stones were CLOSE but not exact. When I got the stone back from LGD I quickly inspected it to see if I could see the particle looking stuff on the 360. I couldn't see anything with the naked eye which gave true VS1 clarity that was on the IGI report. LGD support was really good with fast shipping.



There were some who said I had overpaid for that diamond, however, seeing it in person it has crazy sparkle and I was really impressed with it overall. I really hope my girlfriend loves this ring as much as I did designing it. I was a little concerned with the Pave' but after spending some time with this ring, I think it all came together well.



I've attached the completed ring. The 3CT stone alone with have been 60k plus as a natural diamond. I just looked at it as a diamond is a diamond and has the exact same properties without some guy digging it out with his blood, sweat and tears. Anyways, I hope this review serves somebody out there well. Totally recommend. I've been designing this ring since November.",37,8,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r2vgg0

I'm looking to get a pendant made, and she offered up this stone as they are very limited on champagne diamonds (I don't like bright white diamonds, I love warmth).  It would be paired with green and blue lab sapphires.

She said they could get it IGI certified for $100, but how important is that really for a pendant?  The price is good but the sapphires won't have certificates either, so...I'm torn.  

Also they have it marked VS so I'm not really even sure what that means if it isn't certified.  I can't get a video in bright light right now due to the holiday.

I’ve just become engaged to an American man, and he was so lost of styles he asked me for suggestions.

Many of you know I have been engaged before and that my fiancé died, and the ring he designed me is a gorgeous Edwardian/Art Deco style in white and blue diamonds with a large black central diamond. For obvious reasons I’d prefer to avoid that anything anywhere close to that style as much as possible, although I don’t mind something featuring the same stones.

I want to reflect my Irish heritage (Born and live in the North of Ireland) so I’m thinking Celtic. Interwoven bands, perhaps designs that look almost mythical themselves, like something Arwen would have worn in LOTR (I’d love that, one of my middle names came from an Irish myth). I’ve of course considered the traditional claddagh too but would rather go a bit more out there.

I have very little idea on stones. Every time I mention one to someone I get told how there’s some kind of superstition about it. This is not helpful. At the moment I’m thinking either diamond or emerald with diamond.

In terms of personal style, I’m a Victoriana goth (corsets, petticoats) but always with a touch of fun. I usually wear silver as gold clashes terribly with my colouring but would be open to metals like rhodium or platinum, or to gold being used on a silver design as a feature or something.

OK. Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions, if you’re still here?

TL;DR: Newly engaged Victoriana goth seeks Celtic myth style ring in silver and is desperate for recommendations for this or anything remotely similar. Open on stones but thinking emerald and diamonds. Please help! My part of Ireland has nothing!

EDIT: Today, we chose my ring! I published a picture on the sub.

Thanks so much to those of you who helped me out with ideas and gave me the names of places to look at, as well as the Most Esteemed Professor Gemologist Nerd who gave me some FANTASTIC advice about emeralds!

Since I’m born and bred Irish and live in Belfast, I wanted something Celtic and Irish and playing up the mythology, since one of my middle names is an Irish goddess (Macha). I also wanted the main stone to be green because “The Emerald Isle.” It will also match my bridal bouquet (lilies of the valley, trailing ivy, shamrocks.)

I’ll obviously post a picture with it on once I have it but it still has to be custom made and sent from the United States, and I’m busting with excitement. The picture shows yellow gold, but this is basically what it will look like. I’m having it made in white gold instead as yellow gold clashes horrifically with my skin tone, using white sapphires and a 2ct lab grown green sapphire that looks just like an emerald (specifically asked them to substitute it for a mined Zambian emerald because ethics, and a lab green sapphire rather than lab emerald because of Gemologist Nerd’s advice. Thank you a hundred thousand times, Gemologist Nerd.)

I’m really glad that (with you guys’ help ❤️) we were able to find a way to work my heritage and personal style into practicality. Thank you.

From what I understand, D–E–F color and VVS/VS clarity lab-grown diamonds are sourced from Surat at around ₹9K–10K per carat. However, many brands are selling them for ₹35K–40K per carat, which feels overpriced—especially considering the resale value is almost nil outside the original store.



For example, if a company can source a new diamond for ₹9K, why would they buy it back from me for ₹25K? That’s what makes it hard for me to justify the markup.



My main goal is to invest more in gold, but pure gold rings often don’t have the kind of modern designs I’m looking for in an engagement ring. I’m willing to pay for a diamond mainly for the design, durability, and lifetime shine. Lab-grown diamonds seem like a practical option for that.



Here are some brands I’ve looked at (but found expensive per carat):

\- Emori

\- Fiona Diamonds

\- Limelight Diamonds

\- Heer by GIVA

does anyone have ideas or insights into what depth or table I should be looking at or other specs to look out for? any comments on the visual carat being very diff from the actual carat? I'm looking at 3.0-4.0 carat. some of the 3.1s have a visual of 3.6.. what's up with that?

1r4zwuu,Diamonds,lab created diamond,1771113562.0,2026-02-14,2026,2,"A simple diamond story, in a simpler time","I thought today being Valentine's Day I'd share the story of the engagement ring I bought for my Wife in 1969.  I lived in a small New England town, the kind with a Village Green and Colonial era homes and stores surrounding it.  We had a Jeweler named John that most everyone used (and got frustrated with or just accepted).  John was always sitting in the front of the store's window working at his bench.  He sort of typified what one thinks of as an old Jeweler.  Bushy eyebrows that went all over the place, ear hair that should have disrupted his hearing and a bald pate that positively glistened.  So, John sat in his window everyday, with a sawed off shotgun next to his chair, when you walked into his store there was a line of glass display cases that were filled like an aquarium with business correspondence envelopes from various Companies,  most of them unopened and always the subject of questioning discussion amongst the locals.  Across from the display cabinets was a safe that was five foot tall and four foot wide.  When one brought in a watch to be repaired he would take it and offer you a loaner to use (usually a new watch, and Seiko's were just coming into the US, and he'd usually lend you a Seiko).  Now, John never used an identification tag on whatever you brought in, and he would always say he would have the repair finished in a week or so.  The repairs, somehow never got done.  You would go back, maybe once a month for a year or so and the repair would not have been completed, finally you would ask for the item back and John would go to some part of the store's display case and pull out an envelope and say here it is and hand it to you and you would give back your loaner.  I think he always planned to get to fixing things, he  just never did.  If you walked in with a cracked watch crystal, he'd repair it on the spot for  50 cents, but repairs were a different story.  Anyway, John was a quirky fixture in my life and when I wanted to buy an engagement and wedding ring I visited his store for the purchase.  Remember, this was 1969-- I walked in and explained I wanted to buy a diamond and a matching wedding band and told John I had the princely sum of $300.  He told me he thought he could find something that would work for me.  Now, I had been visiting that store my whole life and never would have expected what happened next.  John walked over to aquarium style envelope filled display cases and pulled out a couple of envelopes and opened them and pulled out a number of diamonds out of each one he retrieved. This continued for a maybe 3 or 4 envelopes, then he walked over to the huge safe, which always had the door partially open and pulled out several black velvet trays littered with diamonds, he gave a quick look through the trays and returned them to the safe.  Finally, he pulled out a handkerchief from his back pocket (BTW, dirty) and there were maybe a half dozen diamonds in the middle of it and he picked one and say, this is a nice stone, it's 5/8's of a carat, and good clarity and color, but has a flaw that won't be noticeable once it is set.  We picked out the white gold setting for the diamond and a matching wedding band, which he engraved in Script that one needed either perfect eyes or a hand lens to read ""as Spring Blooms"".  The ring set, being about the thickness of a pull ring on a soda can, after some years wore away and was placed in a jewelry box for safe keeping.  About 25 years ago I had a neighbor that was a jeweler that worked out of a little 10 x 10 shed on his property and I took some scrap gold and the diamond to him and asked to have a new ring made.  This was the ring he created and my Wife wears it every day.  We've been married almost 56 years.... (yes, it needs cleaning).

The price they’ve offered seems reasonable, but I’m feeling anxious about the authenticity of the seller and the overall transaction.

Here are my main concerns:

* They don’t have an official website.
* Their Instagram page has very few followers and limited engagement.
* They don’t appear to have a physical store that I can visit (or at least not one that’s accessible to me).

They’ve shared their GST certificate, which is somewhat reassuring, but I still have several worries:

* What if I transfer the money and they block me, and I never receive the ring?
* What if they deliver something different from what was promised? For example, I expect 18K gold but receive 14K, or the diamond quality (cut, clarity, color, carat) doesn’t match what was agreed upon.
* Even if I verify the BIS hallmark and IGI certificate after receiving the ring, what happens if they stop responding once the deal is closed?

This is a significant and expensive purchase for me. If something goes wrong, I may have to approach the police, which is a stressful and time-consuming process I would really like to avoid.

I genuinely want to move forward with this purchase, but I also want to make sure I’m protecting myself from potential fraud.

What precautions should I take to safeguard my money and ensure I receive exactly what I’m paying for?

I reached out directly to Provence's website as I hadn't worked with them before and get overwhelmed at choosing reps.  Lisa reached out to me via WhatsApp and was phenomenal to work with.  I have previously bought pieces from Kuololit and Fiorese and have never been so happy.   I originally debated on replacing the stone in my engagement band and getting it reshanked but opted to have the original moissanite set in a way it the ring integrity was slightly compromised just to keep it for sentimentality.

Vendor Selection:  I reached out to all major vendors mentioned on reddit.  I chose Lisa as she had kite shaped lab diamonds in stock, responded quickly and was incredibly kind from the beginning.  Kite shaped proved hard to find not custom cut in a large size and giving proportions was difficult due to the lack of loose cut stones I could find online.  Kuololit made my original ring (was stock at the time) but didn't seem to understand modifications/dimensions when I reached out to him and quote was much lower than the cost of gold weight alone.  Starsgem did not have kites in stock. Fiorese did not have kites in stock and the rep I spoke to wasn't communicating on stones in a way I felt confident. Ouros did have kite in stock but I did not feel confident with them after recent reviews. Zulevio responded after I had purchased with a higher quote.

Lisa Review:   Lisa was the kindest, most understanding and had by far the best communication of any Chinese vendor I have ever worked with across product categories.  She responded promptly and was beyond patient with me when I questioned my stone and dimension choices after the stone had been procured.  She was also very patient with my round of cad revisions and lack of design clarity in the beginning as I researched to make sure we designed a ring that would last a lifetime.  I will use Lisa again next time I want custom jewelry as well point friends and family to her.  Lisa didn't ask for a review but I am over the moon with her service and would recommend her to anyone.

Ring Review:  This is the prettiest ring I have ever seen and the quality is superb.  Using calipers, post polish dimensions are spot on and the stones are incredibly well set and cut.  I appreciate Lisa's attention to detail and using extra prongs on the pave.  The 18kt gold is divine.  All stones are well set and much care was taken in building the ring.

Stone: Kite has few reviews or examples on reddit.  My previous ring was moissanite so I will include a picture of it for comparison as I had wondered the visual difference in moissanite to diamond in kite.  I much prefer the diamond as the refraction makes the tip look almost brilliant due to the sharp angle of the step cuts.  I had chipped and scratched my original moissanite to the naked eye and this was confirmed by two jewelers under microscope. I didn't realize how much larger the face up size is of kite compared to other diamond shapes and the stones were significantly more expensive per karat across vendors.

Hi! I am deciding on an elongated cushion lab diamond. what do you all think about this one? I am NOT looking for a very crushed ice appearance. I like the sparkle and shine that comes off a round brilliant. I want a hybrid diamond that just leans a bit more brilliant than crushed ice. not completely brilliant if that makes sense.  it is also a visual 4.53 if that helps.

I'm heavily leaning towards purchasing online through Rare Carat / Calavera price match. Or similar vendors.

I have been talking to a big box diamond store, to get a better sense of what I am getting into. I brought up the fact that they (the big box store) are quite a bit more expensive than the competitive online market. At this point they wanted to show me what they call ""Subjectivity Stones"". Now these are natural diamonds that have the same specs from GIA, but you could tell one was much more clear and sparkly than the other.

They pointed out that they typically get their pick of the litter to select the best of the batch, and the cheaper online options often times get what is leftover from those stores with big buying power.

My question is if I go with a top spec Lab Grown diamond online through someone like Calatrava, what are the chances the actual product will be less than ideal? Or vary greatly from what I see in these ""discerning"" brick and mortar stores? In store Labs with the same specs are 3x - 5x the cost of what I am seeing online.

If there is that amount of variation in gradings, I don't mind going the In Store route, but would prefer to get my money's worth while also not sacrificing quality.

What should we change while we can?","We picked up my ring and immediately noticed the head looked unfinished. We went back and the jeweler explained they had to build the center “stem” taller because my diamond was too large for the stock setting, and they couldn’t polish the joint further without damaging the milgrain.

They offered to remake it properly by sending the stone + design to the manufacturer and customizing the setting from the start by widening the cathedral so the stone can sit lower. We’ll get to approve the CAD this time.

We do wish this had been explained when we selected the setting/stone or at pickup, instead of waiting for us to bring it up first, but at least they’re fixing it.

Since we now have a redo opportunity, we want to be thorough. what details should we specifically check in the CAD or ask to change?

Currently on our list:

• Make sure the center stone sits straight

• Lower profile if possible

• Clean transition at the head/stem

Specs:

2.59 ct lab diamond

1.39 ratio

Natural marquise + round side stones

Cathedral setting with milgrain

I originally wanted a 3ct and more elongated, but this stone had noticeably better sparkle than the larger ones we saw, so we chose it.

And yes I’m involved in designing the ring. The proposal will still be a surprise! 🙂

The chain is a foxtail chain I got from u/Friendly\_Read\_3846. If you’re looking for chains, find him. His prices are much better than overseas prices right now and the chain is solid.

It’s a 5ct D VS1 Marquise. I wanted the bezel to be prominent, I didn’t want a thin line of gold. Happy made what I wanted. Even the bale was my request and she made it happen and big enough to accommodate a 3mm chain. It’s such a big pendant, it needs something substantial. That’s why I turned to Ott Family Jewelry for the chain. Overseas prices on chains are just out of control. The bracelet is a kind of tennis bracelet. It’s a compass set bracelet so you mostly see diamonds, but happy weighted the back in gold so it doesn’t flip. It’s D-E VVS-VS. The pendant is certified, the bracelet is not. I could not imagine the box for 29 certifications. My aunt said my jewelry is intense, pretty, but intense. So am I. It’s all beautiful and I will never stray from Happy again. The pendant is currently on a gold filled chain because the findings are making it impossible to fit through the bale, so the necklace is heading to Quick Jewelry Repairs for new findings so it will slide with no problems.

So here’s some info about my taste:

\- I don’t mind simple settings. 

\- I want a yellow gold band. 

\- I love marquis cuts, but am generally open to other ideas. 

\- I am not closed off to lab-grown diamonds if the setting is unique enough, or if it’s accompanied with gemstones — but I really prefer a shiny/reflective gemstone if it’s possible with the budget. 

\- I’m also open to having a basic-ish lab-grown diamond ring and buying a unique wedding band later, although this is kind of Plan C. I’m staying open! 

Here are some questions I have for yall! 

1. Alexandrite — I feel like fresh lab-grown alexandrite rings are super shiny and beautiful, but I feel like the rings I see that have been worn a bit look dull and cheap. Is that true? What is your experience with that? 

2. Sapphires — I know natural sapphires are more expensive than lab-grown diamonds. Above all, I am valuing reflection and shine. Is it worth the gamble on a lab grown sapphire, or should I pick a lab-grown diamond/moissanite? 

4. Are there other sturdy gemstones that you suggest? I know moss agate is popular, but I don’t know much about it. 

3. If your ring is around the $1k mark, I’d love to see it!! Any kind, any stone, I just want to see what the options are! It’s hard for me to gage pricing online because for companies like Shane Co ect, you’re only seeing the setting price. 

We plan to go shopping soon, and I know that will be really insightful, but I’d like to set realistic expectations for myself beforehand and have a good idea on what my options are.

My partner and I are ring shopping and she has really narrowed down what she wants and it is basucally this look but all stones diamonds. She is open to the two marquis being something green. I guess green saphire would be our best option.

Now, finding a ring set just like this is virtually impossible, especially with the abnormal prongs, so we have to go custom. **What originally started as a 2.5k ring has turned into a 4-5.5 k ring and I just can't afford it**, even if financing. 

I HATE the idea of telling her it isn't doable. She knows what she wants. I would kick myself forever if she had to settle for less.

**Does anyone have any suggestions on getting a custom ring that will cost less than most jewelers?** I understand that the price of gold is a huge factor that I cannot bypass. My understanding is that the gold ring, the diamond (1.3 karat) and the labor of creating custom is what makes this ring expensive, not the accent stones.

After going back and forth on shapes for the longest time, I finally chose a 2 carat marquise blue lab-grown diamond from Loose Grown Diamonds and I’m honestly so glad I did. I was drawn to the marquise because of how elegant and elongated it looks on the finger. It gives that dramatic, almost regal vibe, and it definitely faces up larger than many other shapes at the same carat weight.

The ordering process was straightforward. I spent quite a bit of time comparing specs and proportions before deciding. Once I placed the order, shipping was surprisingly fast, which helped ease my anxiety about buying such an important piece online. It arrived securely packaged and exactly as described.

When I saw the stone in person for the first time, I was genuinely impressed. The blue color is beautiful, noticeable and unique without looking artificial. In natural light it looks crisp and vibrant, and indoors it takes on a slightly deeper tone. The sparkle is still very much there despite the color, and the cut looks well-balanced with no obvious dark bow-tie effect. Overall, the stone quality was exactly what I hoped for.

I decided to have the ring made at my local jewelry store rather than ordering a setting online. That was 100% the right decision for me. Being able to sit down in person, go over prong placement (especially important with marquise tips), band thickness, and overall proportions made the whole process feel more personal and secure. The jeweler had no issues setting the stone, and everything came together beautifully.

From start to finish, everything went smoothly. Fast shipping, a lovely stone, accurate certification, and no surprises. I know ordering a diamond online can feel intimidating, but in my case everything was good and exactly as expected.

If you’re considering a marquise especially a colored one I’d definitely recommend paying attention to the cut and proportions, and working with a trusted local jeweler for the setting. It made the experience feel complete.

Hope this helps someone who’s deciding!",24,4,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ra672y

Where can I find more ?,"I have a preference for warm colored lab diamonds and was wondering if others seek them out. The Lab Pear in the above 14k yellow gold ring with side Lab Emeralds is a J color VS1 of 3.52 carats. The warmth isn't as noticeable in yellow gold but with a Lab collection from D to N, I prefer the warmer stones from J on up. I think I was greatly influenced by my mother's engagement ring which was a small diamond with a strong yellow to it, but not enough to be a fancy. I just feel warm diamonds look nicer.

The strange thing I've noticed is, in the world of Lab diamonds warm colored stones are harder to find and unlike their natural counterparts, warm diamonds seem to cost more when I do find them now. For instance RubyHarper carries M color but a less than 2 carat and VS2 clarity M starts over $500 and quickly goes up over $1000 for some 1 1/2 carat stones. Yet a better clarity 1.97 carat G at VVS2 is only $367.

My boyfriend and I picked out this engagement ring together and I wanted to get some outside opinions because I’m not a diamond expert.

	•	Emerald cut

	•	Color: D

	•	Clarity: VVS1

	•	Cut/Polish/Symmetry: EX/EX

	•	Fluorescence: Faint

	•	Setting: Platinum, 1/5ct natural diamond side stones (6 stones)

	•	Includes lifetime warranty

	•	Total cost: Around $8,000

From what I’ve seen here, I’m worried maybe we paid a bit too much even though we really focused on quality over size. I’d love to hear whether this price seems reasonable for the specs.

(First ring - where it started; upgraded ring - how it’s going; we love symbolism and when small details have a personal meaning.) It’s the dream ring I imagined having in my early 20s before I realized how much diamonds cost lol. My original ring is a round 0.9 carat natural diamond with pave halo setting on a white gold band. It is so lovely but a very delicate setting and all the little diamonds would fall out throughout the years. 

My only issue with my new ring is that it slides around on my finger. Wondering what you all think I could do to fix this issue? It’s a size 4.5 and I don’t think I can go any smaller for it to fit over my knuckle. I know part of the reason the ring slides is because of the large stone size. What can I do to keep the simplicity of the ring, ie not take attention away from the stone but keep it from sliding? You’ll notice even my wedding band is super simple, no diamonds just a thin platinum band. Would appreciate any suggestions! Thanks!",28,46,0.81,https://i.redd.it/tk3gku9fevkg1.jpeg

Now though, my wife has asked for a divorce and to help myself cope, I want to get a pretty necklace for myself and she never bought me jewelery.  I am thinking I want something around 1-2ct with a gold chain that is dainty and feminine.  I want the stone to be what captures the eye.

While I I do not want to break the bank I was hoping to spend no more than $2k if at all possible.  I am a businesswoman VP who has a lot of client meetings so I want something that is beautiful, but not gaudy.  I went over the top on my ex-wife's ring in terms of quality and size and I do not want to do that this time, I believe I spent $20k for that ring and am not looking to do that again.

My question is, given my parameters, what is the best way to balance what I'm looking for as far as the 4 Cs.  What are the minimums I can get without feeling like its cheap or tacky.  Lab-grown is also fine this time around.  Also, what other characteristics should I be looking for? I remember when I bought the aforementioned diamond, there was a lot of advice surrounding the ""table"" of the diamond, etc.

Finally, it seems like the best place to find a diamond is a different website and then have a jeweler price match it for me.  Is that accurate? Where should I be looking for the loose stone?

What I’m hoping for input on:

1. Quality of the diamond and on if this color actually suit my skin tone? I was initially hesitating because I thought it might be a bit cool toned for me but have since learned that could have just been the store lighting contributing. 

2. Is $3,300 too much even accounting 

for jeweler markup?

We’re working with a reputable jeweler in our area, so I do expect there to be some premium compared to online pricing.

Now I’m thinking about getting myself a small natural piece as a milestone gift… and wondering if I’m overthinking this whole thing.



If you’ve had both, do they feel different to you long-term? Or is a diamond just a diamond at the end of the day?",0,70,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/1rduur0/anyone_regret_going_labgrown_instead_of_natural/

1rdw5or,EngagementRings,lab grown diamond,1771974831.0,2026-02-24,2026,2,My 14 year upgraded stack from Gemestonia,"I wanted to share my experience with upgrading my rings X number of years later because I see it mentioned here a lot as advice when getting the absolute dream ring right now isn’t feasible. I know it can be hard to wait or look into the future, but hang in there - it’s sound advice!

Back in 2010 when my then-boyfriend proposed, he proposed with a three-stone princess cut ring from Kay’s. It was what I wanted and what we could afford at the time. To be honest, I didn’t really look ahead to potentially upgrading my ring. I loved the ring well enough. There was never a wedding band that was made for this ring, so I got some slightly curved bands from Shane Co and had them soldered together. Five years later, I came across a jeweler here on Reddit (shoutout if you remember the garbage disposal story that made him popular), and commissioned him make me a 1 carat round moissanite ring with a halo and a wedding band, also soldered together. I really love this set, and it was quite an affordable way to get an upgrade. Again, I didn’t look ahead and think that I’d want any future upgrades.

Fast forward to last year when this subreddit popped up in my algorithm with the absolute most beautiful parti sapphire engagement ring I’ve ever laid eyes on. I didn’t even know what a parti sapphire was. Thankfully the OP shared the maker - Gemestonia. I started following him on Instagram and watched all the gorgeous pieces he makes. I had my eye on a 2.98 carat oval parti sapphire, and once I solidified my ideas for a ring, I reached out. Not only did he make my dream a reality, I had the ring on my doorstep in under a month. He was fantastic to work with, and the design process was surprisingly fast and very smooth. I shouldn’t be surprised that it only took another month or two before I wanted to expand the stack a little. 😂 He created a gold band (with my children’s birth stones flush mount) as a something of a spacer band to snug up to my sapphire ring, along with the half eternity band of pear and round lab diamonds. The two rings showed up just a few days ago and I can’t stop admiring the sparkle. I truly cannot recommend working with Gemestonia enough!

It’s funny that I never really considered upgrading initially, but tastes change, and dang it, if you can do it and you want to - you should! If something isn’t in the cards right now, upgrading as a future anniversary could be a great option. I still very much love my original set and my 5 year upgraded set - a girl needs options! My favorite color is green and after lurking around this sub for a while, I’ve really fallen in love with other stones as the focal point. I also really love seeing all the unique designs. I hadn’t seen a tulip setting quite like mine here yet, so I wanted to share it along with the experience of upgrading later on. I think I told myself I’d wait for our 15 year anniversary, but 14 seemed close enough 😆",390,51,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1rdw5or

I wanted to make it special and combine the two designs, so I went in again with a friend and discussed it with the jeweler. I \*\*\*thought\*\*\* I made it clear that I wanted a combination of the two designs, and they quoted me $2800 for the engagement ring with a .55 carat lab diamond centerpiece and 2 smaller (\~ .2 carat) lab diamond surrounds, and lab diamond wrap twists. The wedding band was going to be an additional $1200 14k white gold with lab diamond wrap twists.

I picked it up today and got pic #1, basically identical to the rose gold ring with just a single .55 carat lab grown center, and an engagement band that is identical to the wedding band.

If there was a miscommunication and original quote was only for a single .55 carat centerpiece design, and the identical wedding band cost $1200…

Is it reasonable that the engagement ring’s single .55 carat lab diamond and setting would cost an additional $1600 on top of the base $1200 for the engagement band? Or did something get screwed up and I somehow got the wrong design with the quote?",8,12,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1rdxmls

I originally bought my first large stone from Luvansh and the setting was a disaster. This was at the very beginning of when Luvansh was gaining popularity and there wasn’t a lot of negative posts about them yet AND it was my second lab grown purchase. I reached out to them and they were going to charge me for fixing their poor setting. 

I didn’t know if I could trust Luvansh for a second round, so I took my ring to a jeweler I trust for the repair. I decided I would rather pay more for work that I could trust than end up with the potential back and forth with Luvansh. My jeweler ended up cracking my stone on accident. It was so very sad, but accidents happen. They were bending backwards to make things right. They replaced my stone with an even better quality stone which happened to be even larger. They also let me design my setting from scratch. This ring is the result of that process.

I know large stones are not everyone’s cup of tea, so please withhold any negative comments about the size.

I know I know it’s bad but I snooped on his phone and found out it was originally around $1,300 but he got a deal which brought it down to around $800-900.

My ring holds some family history! 

My fiancee and I got together with my grandmother to craft my dream ring. She had antique pieces from her life starting as early as childhood. She raised me, she's now 80 distributing out her jewelry to close family and believed I was deserving of her most sentimental diamond.

My grandmother grew up with a very dysfunctional family dynamic, which I'm sure wasn't too rare in the 50's. She was raised by a man that was not her birth father, but treated her as his own and loved her unlike any blood ever did. Unfortunately he died very early in her life when she was about 16-18. He owned a lot of nice jewelry, and this one giant diamond she always admired. After he passed, she was able to snag the diamond before her toxic family arrived and took everything. It was all she got from him, and held onto it for all these years, having it put onto a different yellow gold band.

When my fiancee and I were brought with the proposition of using this diamond and other old jewelry of hers, I didn't realize how lucky we were. At first, I was still set on my want for an oval shaped stone, at least 1.5 karat, lab grown. But with much consideration, and me never wanting to ball out on a ring anyway, it didn't take me long to decide to go with the family stone.

The fiancee and I set out to a well recommended jewelry store with our treasures. It didn't take long to realize we made the right decision. The jeweler told us they don't make this cut anymore!

They used other jewelry my grandmother also let us take, melted the gold and pulled stones. It ended up being an absolute steal price wise for the engagement ring and wedding band (petite eternity).

It’s a CVD type IIA stone but was wondering about what to expect with the post-growth treatment? What are the pros and cons? Is it permanent? Will it ever revert back? Is this something to avoid? I really need help so any advice or knowledge would be helpful!!! ,1,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/labdiamond/comments/1reyppz/are_postgrowth_treatments_on_lab_diamonds_good_or/

But we had other ideas!! Hand fabricated in platinum, we gave her an 8mm wide band, sophisticated hand engraved bright cuts, two flush set brilliant cut diamonds, milgrain on every edge, and finished with black rhodium detailing. This one demands attention! 🤩

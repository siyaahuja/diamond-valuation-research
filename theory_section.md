Theoretical Framework: Symbolic Value Persistence Under Material Replication
3.1 The Lancasterian Foundation
Following Lancaster (1966), we treat consumer utility as derived not from goods themselves but from the bundle of characteristics they embody. A diamond is not consumed as an undifferentiated object but as a vector of attributes: carat weight, cut quality, colour, clarity, and - crucially - origin. In the standard Lancasterian framework, two goods that produce identical characteristic bundles are perfect substitutes and should command identical prices in competitive equilibrium. The existence of a persistent price premium for natural diamonds over laboratory-grown stones that are physically identical by every measurable characteristic therefore constitutes an anomaly within the standard model that requires theoretical extension.
We propose that the anomaly is resolved by recognising that origin functions as a distinct characteristic in the Lancasterian sense - one that produces utility independently of physical properties. Specifically, origin produces what we term symbolic utility: the satisfaction derived not from the physical properties of the stone but from its provenance, its scarcity narrative, and the social signals it conveys to others. Let the utility function of consumer i be:
U_i = f(M, S_i, I_i)
Where M denotes the vector of measurable physical characteristics (carat, cut, colour, clarity), S_i denotes the symbolic utility derived from origin for consumer i, and I_i denotes the consumer's level of information about material equivalence between natural and laboratory-grown stones.
3.2 The Symbolic Utility Component
The symbolic utility S_i has three sub-components:
S_i = α·T + β·P_i + γ·E_i
Where T denotes tradition value - the utility derived from participation in an established cultural practice with historical depth; P_i denotes positional value - the Veblenian utility derived from conspicuous expenditure that signals wealth and taste to others; and E_i denotes ethical value - the utility (or disutility) derived from the perceived ethical characteristics of the stone's origin, including environmental impact and supply chain conditions.
Each sub-component responds differently to the emergence of laboratory-grown alternatives. Tradition value T is relatively inelastic - it is anchored in cultural narratives that change slowly and are actively maintained by the diamond industry, the bridal market, and intergenerational transmission of norms around engagement and marriage. Positional value P_i is partially elastic - it depends on the social legibility of origin as a signal, which erodes as laboratory-grown diamonds become mainstream and the observable difference between natural and synthetic stones becomes imperceptible to non-experts. Ethical value E_i is highly elastic and may in fact reverse sign for environmentally conscious consumers - laboratory-grown diamonds may generate positive ethical utility that natural diamonds cannot.
3.3 The Information Moderation Effect
The parameter I_i - consumer information about material equivalence - acts as a moderator of the relationship between origin and symbolic utility. At low levels of I_i, consumers may derive symbolic utility from a belief in the physical uniqueness or superiority of natural diamonds that is factually incorrect. As I_i increases - driven by GIA's 2019 decision to grade laboratory-grown diamonds using identical criteria to natural stones, by media coverage of material equivalence, and by the discourse we observe in our Reddit corpus - the basis for positional signalling through natural diamond ownership shifts from material distinction to pure origin signalling.
This generates a testable prediction: the origin premium should be larger among consumers with lower information levels (older buyers, less digitally engaged buyers) and smaller among highly informed consumers (the Reddit demographic). This is consistent with our empirical finding that the premium persists strongly in retail price data - which captures the full market including traditional buyers - while Reddit discourse shows declining salience of origin as a deliberative topic.
3.4 The Velthuis-Coslor Extension
Velthuis and Coslor (2012) introduced the concept of valuation work to describe the active institutional labour required to maintain price premiums in art and luxury markets. They argue that prices in these markets are not discovered through competitive equilibrium but constructed through ongoing interpretive and rhetorical activity by market participants including dealers, critics, auction houses, and industry bodies.
We extend their framework to the case of material replication. In the standard Velthuis-Coslor model, valuation work maintains premiums by constructing and defending narratives of uniqueness, authenticity, and cultural significance. When material replication is impossible - as in the art market where each work is unique - valuation work operates within a stable material reality. When material replication becomes possible at scale, as with laboratory-grown diamonds, valuation work faces a fundamentally new challenge: it must maintain a symbolic distinction in the absence of a material one.
We propose that this generates what we term a valuation lag - the period between the achievement of material equivalence and the erosion of the symbolic premium. During the valuation lag, traditional consumers continue to pay the premium because their valuation frameworks have not yet updated to incorporate material equivalence, while leading-edge consumers (captured in our Reddit corpus) have already updated and are driving the declining salience of origin as a deliberative topic. The persistence of the premium in our price data alongside the declining dominance of origin discourse in our topic model is direct empirical evidence of this valuation lag operating in real time.
3.5 Formal Propositions
Proposition 1: In a market where two goods are materially equivalent but differ in origin, a symbolic premium will persist as long as a sufficient mass of consumers derive positional or tradition utility from origin that exceeds the price differential between the goods.
Proof sketch: Let the market consist of consumers with heterogeneous S_i. The premium persists at equilibrium price P* if the marginal consumer at P* is indifferent between natural and lab-grown, implying S_i(natural) - S_i(lab) = P* - P_lab for the marginal consumer. As long as the distribution of S_i has sufficient mass above this indifference threshold, the premium is sustained regardless of what informed consumers at the lower tail of the S_i distribution do.
Proposition 2: The symbolic premium will be superlinear in expenditure level - larger absolute premiums will be observed at higher price points - because positional utility scales with the visibility and social legibility of the expenditure signal.
Proof sketch: Positional utility P_i is an increasing function of the social signal value of the purchase. Signal value is increasing in expenditure because high expenditure is more legible as a signal of wealth and commitment. Therefore dS_i/dP > 0 and d²S_i/dP² > 0 for the positional component, generating superlinear scaling of the premium with carat weight, consistent with our empirical finding that the premium rises from 126% at 0.5 carats to 992% at 3 carats.
